Transcritical Flows

 
 
Transcritical flow research at the FX Lab focuses on the complex coupling between real-fluid dynamics at elevated high-pressure conditions and the underlying hydrodynamic and combustion processes. The non-linear effects of interest include the enhancement of thermodynamic response functions across the Widom line, as well as the dynamical process of local interfacial vanishing due to the transition from subcritical to supercritical conditions. Our studies on transcritical flows uncover novel mechanisms arising from this thermodynamic/hydrodynamic coupling that have direct impact on the analysis and design of modern high-performance IC, turbine, and rocket engines.
Energy Resources and CO2 Sequestration

 
 
With the depletion of conventional fuel reserves, there is an increasing interest in exploration of unconventional reservoirs. This involves a complex mixture of oil, gas, and water that is trapped in shale and tight rock formations. In addition, to address increasing levels of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, sequestration in conjunction with enhanced oil recovery are strategies to control and mitigate CO2 emissions. However, in order to take advantage of these strategies requires the fundamental scientific understanding of systems and processes involving gases, water and hydrocarbons in nanoporous media. The scale at which these processes occur is on the order of Angstroms to nanometers.

To address these issues, we utilize atomistic simulations (molecular dynamics and density functional theory) for modeling physico-chemical phenomena of trapped CO2 in subsurface reservoirs. These techniques enable simulations of relevant processes, including bond breaking, formation, phase transition and transport. Together with a research team from the School of Earth, Energy and Environmental Sciences, we work towards a better understanding the effects that residual, solubility and mineral trapping of supercritical CO2, water, and hydrocarbons, would have on subsurface reactive transport.
