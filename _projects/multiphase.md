Hot Surface Ignition

Accidental ignition of flammable chemicals like fuel is an industrial safety concern due to the storage and transport of pressurized liquids near components at elevated temperatures. A particular interest in hot surface ignition (HSI) research is on the extreme environments of aircraft engines, motivated by the consequences of in-flight fire. This work provides fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena involved in the thermal ignition of impinging sprays in different temperature regimes toward the goal of improved industrial safety.

Simulations




Complementary 1D and 3D models were developed (Mohaddes, D, and Ihme, M 2022, Mohaddes et al. 2021) for a leaking spray of n-dodecane (jet fuel proxy) impinging on the hot surface of an engine nacelle. At high surface temperatures, the interaction of the spray with the hot surface is governed by the Leidenfrost effect, resulting in inelastic reflection of impinging droplets. Large-eddy simulations are employed with finite-rate chemistry, and low-temperature ignition chemistry is considered. An Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is taken to the describe the spray dynamics. The secondary flow resulting from the spray impingement in the form of a toroidal vortex is shown to enhance scalar mixing. Low-temperature ignition within the vortex significantly precedes high-temperature ignition near the wall and subsequent rapid flame propagation.

Experiments

Now, the focus has shifted to (1) the development of non-intrusive, high-temperature diagnostics for surface temperature and heat flux and (2) conducting model-assessing experiments on a novel HSI apparatus to understand the ignition probability and fire behavior of both fuel droplets and sprays capturing different leak mass flow rate scenarios. Through a computational and experimental approach, this work provides fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena involved in the thermal ignition of impinging sprays in different temperature regimes toward the goal of improved safety and operability.
