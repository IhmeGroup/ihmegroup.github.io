Supercritical and transcritical flows from a macroscopic point of view.

Example papers to pull projects from:
- A regularized-interface method as a unified formulation for simulations of high-pressure multiphase flows
- On the importance of species immiscibility in mixing-layer dynamics at supercritical pressures
- Stable supercritical interfaces do not exist without surface tension
- Mechanisms and models of the turbulent boundary layers at transcritical conditions
- Analysis of ducted fuel injection at high-pressure transcritical conditions using large-eddy simulations
- Supercritical fluids behave as complex networks
- Analysis of real-fluid thermodynamic effects on turbulent statistics in transcritical channel flows
- Regimes of evaporation and mixing behaviors of nanodroplets at transcritical conditions
