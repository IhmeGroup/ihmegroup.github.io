The development of advanced low-emission aircraft engine technologies, along with reductions in noise from the airframe, fan, and jet exhaust, has made engine core noise a more prominent contributor. As a result, achieving future ambitious noise-reduction targets necessitates addressing noise generated by the engine core induced by the combustion processes {% cite ihme_combustion_2017 %}.

Our research at FxLab focuses on understanding and modeling direct and indirect combustion noise, their sources, generation mechanisms, and propagation. One way of understanding the combustion mechanism is through large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent combustion {%cite shao_effect_2020 shao_analysis_2021 %}. We focus on understanding the effects of different operating conditions on the combustion noise in a realistic, advanced gas-turbine combustor {% cite brouzet2024analysis %}. Moreover, we develop a framework to allow efficient and accurate simulation of indirect combustion noise in the presence of complex geometries and flow conditions {% cite o2015linear %}. This framework has been applied to study the effects of compositional inhomogeneities {% cite magri_compositional_2016 %} in the combustor, as well as multi-modal, turbulent entropy fields {% cite Brouzet_Krisna_Ihme_2025 %} on the combustion noise.
