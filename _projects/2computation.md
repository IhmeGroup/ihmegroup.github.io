Challenging to split this up but perhaps we can do something like:

### Data Aggregation (BLASTNet)
- Turbulence in focus: Benchmarking scaling behavior of 3d volumetric super-resolution with blastnet 2.0 data
- BLASTNet simulation dataset

### Machine Learning and Data-Driven Methods
- Artificial intelligence as a catalyst for combustion science and engineering
- Ensemble predictions of laser ignition with a hybrid stochastic physics-embedded deep-learning framework
- Augmenting filtered flame front displacement models for LES using machine learning with a posteriori simulations
- A review of physics-informed machine learning in fluid mechanics
- Machine learning for combustion chemistry
- A Normal-Score Ensemble Kalman Filter for 1D Shock Waves

### Numerical Methods
##### DG
- A high-order diffused-interface approach for two-phase compressible flow simulations using a Discontinuous Galerkin framework
- A high-order diffused-interface approach for fully compressible two-phase flow simulations using a Discontinuous Galerkin method

##### Spectral Methods
- Generalization of the Spectral Difference scheme for the diffused-interface five equation model
- A Spectral Element Enrichment Wall-Model

##### PEC?
- Towards Integration of a Pareto-Efficient Combustion Modeling Framework into High-Order Nek5000 Spectral Element CFD Solver
