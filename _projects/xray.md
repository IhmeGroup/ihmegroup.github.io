To fully characterize the behavior of fluids in complex environments and develop models of engineering relevance, we take a bottom-up approach whereby we combine ultrafast, hard X-ray scattering experiments with statistical mechanics. In particular, we believe that the fluidic behavior at supercritical conditions is governed by the changes in the microstructure. As such, we utilize techniques such as Small/Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (S/WAXS), X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS), and X-ray Pump X-ray Probe (XPXP) to reveal the equilibrium structure, the dynamical structure, and the chemical response of pure supercritical fluids and their mixtures, respectively. Recent efforts have focused on CO2 and H2O with applications in geological carbon sequestration, green chemistry, and radiolysis. An overview of each of these techniques is given below.   
XPCS

 
Spilt-pulse X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy provides a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of the microstructural heterogeneities formed in supercritical fluids near the Widom line. Experiments are carried out at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) using advanced data analysis strategies to extract relevant statistics from the ultrafast measurements. The experiments are complemented with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations in LAMMPS to explore the physics governing the diffusive dynamics and the connection to transport properties, such as diffusivity and thermal conductivity.
XPXP

 
While S/WAXS and XPCS provide a wealth of information on the structure and dynamics of supercritical fluids, they do not resolve the ultrafast, nonequilibrium response due to ionizing radiation. To do so, we conduct X-ray Pump X-ray Probe experiments at SPring-8 in Hyogo, Japan to reveal the length- and time-scales associated with such motions in supercritical water. The results of the studies, along with the development of phenomenological analytical models, are expected to inform the design and operation of nuclear cooling towers, biological radiation damage, and chemical reactivity in green solvents.
