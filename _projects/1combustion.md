Brainstorming for projects:

### Carbon-Free Combustion (Porous Media + Ammonia)
- Turbulence in disguise: Reactive flows in porous media mimic turbulent behavior
- Experimental demonstration of a two-stage porous media burner for low-emission ammonia combustion
- Examining diesel-spray assisted ignition of ammonia under reactivity-controlled conditions using large-eddy simulations
- Integrated experimental and computational analysis of porous media combustion by combining gas-phase synchrotron ŒºCT, IR-imaging, and pore-resolved simulations
- Improving volume-averaged simulations of matrix-stabilized combustion through direct X-ray ¬µCT characterization: Application to NH3/H2-air combustion
- Experimental and numerical investigation of flame stabilization and pollutant formation in matrix stabilized ammonia-hydrogen combustion
- Combustion of lean ammonia-hydrogen fuel blends in a porous media burner

### Hot Surface Ignition
- Experiment and modeling of stochastic ignition and combustion of fuel droplets impacting a hot surface

### Spray Flames
- Interaction of preferential evaporation and low-temperature chemistry in multicomponent counterflow spray flames

### Detonations
- Dynamics and structure of detonations in stratified product-gas diluted mixtures
