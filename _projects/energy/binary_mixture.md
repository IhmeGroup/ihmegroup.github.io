Supercritical fluids (SCFs) are often regarded as homogeneous at the microscopic level, but our studies reveal a different picture: even well-mixed supercritical systems can exhibit hidden structural heterogeneities. Using combined experimental and simulation techniques, we show that supercritical mixtures can undergo spontaneous microscopic phase separation, driven by the formation of energetically favorable clusters. This challenges the classical notion of full miscibility in SCFs and has far-reaching implications for applications in separations, catalysis, and materials synthesis, where nanoscale fluid structure governs macroscopic performance.

In our recent work, we examined both single-component and binary supercritical systems. For pure fluids, we discovered that even above the critical point, transient clusters form that locally resemble a liquid-like phase, initiating a kinetic pathway toward phase separation without any macroscopic interface {% cite fan2024heterogeneous %}. Extending this to mixtures, we studied ethanolâ€“CO2 using synchrotron X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics simulations, finding persistent ethanol-rich clusters stabilized by hydrogen bonding {% cite fan2025supercritical %}. These observations demonstrate that microscopic immiscibility and cluster dynamics are general features of supercritical fluids, governed by a competition between energetic attractions and entropic mixing.
