Guillaume focuses on developing novel combustor concepts for carbon-free fuels like ammonia and hydrogen, with a strong emphasis on fuel flexibility. His current research centers on two main areas: matrix-stabilized flames in open-cell ceramic foams and the active control of combustion using reinforcement learning. Additionally, Guillaume is engaged in fire safety research, specifically investigating fires caused by liquid fuel leaks in high-temperature enclosures.
