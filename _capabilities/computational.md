## Discontinuous Galerkin Methods

Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods offer high orders of accuracy with good numerical dispersion and dissipation properties, especially on unstructured grids. They provide geometric flexibility and *hp*-adaptability, which allows different orders of accuracy to be used in different solution regions for better accuracy. This allows DG solvers to better capture small scale flow structures, flame fronts, and other features common in turbulent reacting flows.

Quail {% cite ching_quail_2022 %} is a lightweight, [open-source](https://github.com/ihmegroup/quail) discontinuous Galerkin code written in-house for teaching and prototyping. Vectorized Python operations are used to improve the computational efficiency while retaining code clarity and modularity. Currently, Quail solves first-order and second-order nonlinear systems of partial differential equations common to the flow physics problems tackled in the lab.

## Machine Learning

Numerical simulations rely on models to describe physical phenomena. Machine learning techniques offer powerful means to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of these models. At the FX Lab, these methods have been applied to reactive flow fields for super-resolution problems and on supercritical fluids for prediction of critical properties. Physics-informed neural networks have also been developed to enhance the training procedure of these techniques, bridging the gap between data-driven models and fundamental physics.

### BLASTNet

[BLASTNet](https://blastnet.github.io) (**B**earable **L**arge **A**ccessible **S**cientific **T**raining **Net**work-of-Datasets) {% cite 10.5555/3666122.3669508 %} is an initiative to curate large amounts of high-fidelity fluid dynamics data in a convenient format for machine learning model applications. There is now over 13 TB of data, which are useful for fluid flows in a wide range of applications tied to automotive, propulsion, energy and the environment. Specifically, scientific engineering tasks related to these domains may include turbulent closure modeling, spatio-temporal modeling, and inverse modeling. In addition, the FX Lab also hosts regular seminars and competitions to disseminate ML for flow physics.
