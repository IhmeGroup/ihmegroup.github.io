	abstract = {In the past, ﬂame geometry was found to play an important role in determining when strong pressure ﬂuctuations associated with a combustion instability occur in a gas turbine model combustor. The goals of this study were to use ﬂame surface area as a more accurate way to quantify the ﬂame shape and the heat release rate, in lieu of chemiluminescence; to accurately resolve both the spatial structure and the time history of the heat release ﬂuctuations, and to show that kilohertz formaldehyde planar laser-induced ﬂuorescence provides a new way to achieve these goals. The dual-swirl burner, developed at DLR Stuttgart by Meier et al. was operated using dimethyl ether (DME) to study ﬂuctuations in the ﬂame surface area, ﬂame brush, ﬂame length, and heat release rate. To understand the instability, accurate measurements are needed of the correlation between heat release rate ﬂuctuations and pressure ﬂuctuations. Thus heat release rate must be recorded as a function of time and space. However conventional chemiluminescence oﬀers only a line-of-sight measurement. High-speed CH2O PLIF was applied to study the motion of ﬂame surfaces in response to the pressure oscillations. Results show that the ﬂame surface density ﬂuctuated at the acoustic frequency (typically 320 Hz). The frequency of the combustion instability was found to increase as either the gas velocity or the ﬂame speed was increased. These trends are consistent with previous n-s theories that model the convective time delay. Strong pressure oscillations occur for conditions when the ﬂame is nearly ﬂat; the instability disappears when the ﬂame becomes V-shaped. The explanation is that all points on a ﬂatter ﬂame have the same convective time delay but this is not true for the V-ﬂame geometry.},

	abstract = {In this work, the acoustic behavior of a combustion instability in a gas turbine model combustor was investigated as fuel properties, air ﬂow rates, and burner geometry were varied. The dual-swirl burner, developed at DLR Stuttgart by Meier, was operated using syngas (H2/CO), ethylene, propane, and methane. The frequency of the instability was found to vary signiﬁcantly from 250 to 480 Hz. When the plenum volume and the exhaust pipe length and diameter were changed, the frequencies followed trends similar to a Helmholtz resonator. The variation of fuel type, ﬂame speed, and air ﬂow rate greatly altered the instability frequency and amplitude. These eﬀects are not predicted by Helmholtz or organ tone acoustic theory. Higher frequencies were correlated with larger laminar burning velocities and higher air ﬂow rates. The burner is a forced resonator, in which the ﬂame oscillations couple with the ﬂowﬁeld to create convectively altered Helmholtz resonances. This suggests the need for an improved model of a forced Helmholtz resonator that includes ﬂame properties. Alkane fuels displayed similar acoustic trends, but ethylene varied greatly from methane and propane. Syngas displayed diﬀerent behavior than hydrocarbon fuels, even when the laminar ﬂame speeds of the fuels were matched between ethylene and a syngas mixture. Flame characteristics such as anchoring, liftoﬀ height, and shape appear to play a major role in the determination of instability strength and presence. With increasing hydrogen-content in the syngas-mixture, the ﬂame transitions from a lifted to a fully anchored ﬂame, resulting in a drastic decrease in the acoustic amplitude associated with non-resonating ﬂames. Rayleigh indices show that ﬂat ﬂames create strong regions of thermoacoustic coupling compared to axially extended V-shape ﬂames. It is concluded that, in the current burner conﬁguration, integrated-acoustics occur that involve a combination of Helmholtz and convectivemechanisms.},

	abstract = {The instability dynamics of inviscid liquid jets issuing from elliptical orifices is studied, and effects of the surrounding gas and the liquid surface tension on the stability behavior are investigated. A dispersion relation for the zeroth azimuthal (axisymmetric) instability mode is derived. Consistency of the analysis is confirmed by demonstrating that these equations reduce to the well-known dispersion equations for the limiting cases of round and planar jets. It is shown that the effect of the ellipticity is to increase the growth rate over a large range of wavenumbers in comparison to those of a circular jet. For higher Weber numbers, at which capillary forces have a stabilizing effect, the growth rate decreases with increasing ellipticity. Similar to circular and planar jets, increasing the density ratio between gas and liquid increases the growth of disturbances significantly. These theoretical investigations are complemented by experiments to validate the local linear stability results. Comparisons of predicted growth rates with measurements over a range of jet ellipticities confirm that the theoretical model provides a quantitatively accurate description of the instability dynamics in the Rayleigh and first wind-induced regimes.},

This technique provides simultaneous and spatially-resolved information about the gas temperature and the biomass density, thereby enabling tracking of the pyrolysis and char oxidation fronts. To achieve well-controlled heating and flow conditioning, oak biomass samples are instrumented above a diffusion flame inside a tube, with total oxygen concentrations of 6\% and 11\% per volume. Experiments are performed on a laboratory XCT system. The flow is diluted with Kr to increase X-ray attenuation in the gas phase thus allowing for simultaneous 3D measurements of sample density and surrounding temperature. XCT scans are acquired every 90 s at a spatial resolution of 135 μm. The high spatial resolution enables the volumetric visualization of the smoldering process that is associated with pyrolysis and char oxidation. These measurements show how the grain structure affects flame stabilization and induces fingering of the pyrolysis front, while crack formation accelerates the char oxidation locally. Evaluations of the sample mass via XCT are compared with load cell measurements, showing good agreement. A low-order model is developed to evaluate the propagation speeds of pyrolysis and oxidation fronts from the X-ray data over time, and comparisons are made with the surface recess speed.},

	abstract = {Fire retardants are used to slow down the spread of wildfires or reduce the flammability of manufactured materials such as plastics and textiles. The chemical pathways for retardant quenching are well understood, and standard flame resistance tests are routinely performed for flammability certification. However, these tests are often limited to measurements of ignition time and global flame spread under different fire conditions. As such, they do not provide detailed information on the local combustion processes. Acquiring detailed fire measurements in-situ remains challenging, mainly because of the multiphase nature of solid fuel combustion and the associated release of smoke and tar. To address these challenges, X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) with simultaneous gas and solid measurements was recently proposed as an in-situ imaging technique for solid fuel combustion. This method provides measurements of both the gas temperature and the structural changes occurring inside solid fuel during combustion. In the present work, simultaneous XCT is employed to examine the pyrolysis and flame spread for untreated wood samples, and for wood samples treated with Phos-Chek fire retardant, a formulation commonly used in wildfires applications. The time-resolved 3D results provide detailed measurements of the charring and oxidation occurring within the fuel, thus highlighting how fire retardant affect these mechanisms.},

The method is illustrated by employing a tabletop X-ray system to image the combustion of different biomass samples heated by convection and radiation. The XCT measurements are utilized to evaluate the gas temperature and quantify the burning rates. In particular, quantitative mea­ surements of the pyrolysis and char oxidation rates are obtained for different types of biomass. Simultaneous 3D gas temperature measurements are enabled by doping the flow with Kr, an inert X-ray contrast gas. To assess the capabilities of XCT as a quantitative and non-intrusive measurement technique, the accuracy of the method is evaluated through repeatability studies, whereas the invasive impact of the XCT method on the combustion is characterized experimentally and theoretically. Finally, the adsorption of Kr on the char during cooling is evi­ denced, and its impact on the measurements is discussed. This analysis highlights that the XCT solid measure­ ments are entirely non-intrusive and are repeatable within 5\% uncertainties, while using Kr for gas temperature measurements results in only a 15\% lower heat transfer by natural convection.},

Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach offers three advantages: (i) the ﬂexibility in the interpolation parameters provides a framework for joint optimization and data-informed dynamic CT, (ii) both continuous motion and sudden changes in voxel values can be represented while preserving the continuity of the interpolated solution, and (iii) the compactness of the interpolation functions reduces the increase in algorithmic cost. Total variation regularization is used with a second-order accurate discretization, and the resulting formulation is solved with the Chambolle-Pock proximal algorithm. The applicability of the method in practical cases is demonstrated using synchrotron data, with an algorithmic cost of two to four times that of equivalent static reconstruction algorithms.},

	abstract = {With transportation fuels being comprised of many compounds with different physicochemical properties, it is important to consider their impact on the combustion behavior. This study investigates the effects of preferential evaporation, in which different components of a liquid fuel evaporate at different rates, in the context of laminar counterflow spray flames. To isolate these effects, simulations are performed by considering a three-component Jet-A (POSF 4658) surrogate, consisting of n-dodecane, methylcyclohexane, and m-xylene with both preferential and non-preferential evaporation models. We show that the preferential evaporation of the more volatile cycloalkane in the preheated stream changes the gas-phase composition upstream of the flame. The lower reactivity of this component results in a downstream shift in the low-temperature chemistry zone. This leads to less penetration of the spray into the flame, a lower fuel consumption speed, and a higher gaseous mixture fraction throughout the reaction zones, compared to the non-preferential model. These effects highlight the necessity of considering preferential evaporation behavior when constructing models for multicomponent spray combustion.},

	abstract = {The dynamics and structure of detonations in stratified, product-gas diluted mixtures are examined using high resolution two-dimensional simulations with detailed chemistry. A stoichiometric methane/oxygen/nitrogen mixture with a product-gas dilution level similar to that found in rotating detonation engines is considered. A parametric analysis of the stratification size is performed. For stratification sizes larger than the induction length lind , the traditional detonation cell structure is lost and triple-points are absent. For stratification sizes an order of magnitude larger than lind , large regions of unburned, cold gases are found far behind the detonation front, and are subsequently consumed through an isobaric combustion process initiated by scalar mixing. This mechanism results in a deficit of energy provided to the detonation and to a significant reduction in the overall detonation velocity. A one-dimensional model using ZND theory is constructed to gain insights on the transient detonation structure. This model predicts a slower detonation velocity through the cold gases, which is supported by the results from the simulations with large stratification sizes. In these cases, the detonation structure is well predicted by the model in the regions that undergo ignition by shock compression, i.e., for intermediate and high levels of product-gas dilution. In the absence of triple-points, the detonation structure and dynamics can be locally considered as quasi-one-dimensional. The model and simulation results have a larger discrepancy for small stratification sizes, implying that phenomena other than adiabatic shock compression, involving heat and/or mass transfer, might play a role to ignite the reactants.},

	abstract = {Combustion noise and sound source mechanisms of the DLR-A flame are investigated. A hybrid large-eddy simulation /computational aeracoustics (LES/CAA) approach is employed. In the first step of the hybrid analysis the flamelet/progress variable (FPV) model is employed as combustion model followed by the acoustic simulation in the second step using the acoustic perturbation equations for reacting flows (APE-RF). The flamelet/progress variable database has been extended in terms of acoustic source terms. The analysis of the acoustic field of low MACH number reacting flows induced by the thermoacoustic sources such as the unsteady heat release leads to a very stiff problem formulation, since the related sources require highly resolved regions in the source area, which restricts the possible time step. To simulate combustion generated noise using such a hybrid approach, a suitable source description has to be used, which preferably satisfies two requirements, i.e, to efficiently and accurately predict the generated sound field, while the source term can be easily evaluated from the LES. Using the source term, which is expressed via the scaled partial time derivative of the density, the acoustic field can be reproduced best up to a maximum STROUHAL number of StD = 2. However, this source formulation requires a rigorous constraint at the interface of the hybrid approach to avoid spurious noise due to artificial acceleration caused by interpolation. To be more precise, the convection speed of density inhomogeneities has to be preserved during interpolation. A compromise between efficiency and accuracy can be achieved using the source formulation expressed via the scaled material derivative of the density, since by definition this formulation does not describe the convection of density inhomogeneities.},

	abstract = {The increasing incidence and severity of wildﬁres underscores the necessity of accurately predicting their behavior. While high-ﬁdelity models derived from ﬁrst principles oﬀer physical accuracy, they are too computationally expensive for use in real-time ﬁre response. Low-ﬁdelity models sacriﬁce some physical accuracy and generalizability via the integration of empirical measurements, but enable real-time simulations for operational use in ﬁre response. Machine learning techniques have demonstrated the ability to bridge these objectives by learning ﬁrst-principles physics while achieving computational speedups. While deep learning approaches have demonstrated the ability to predict wildﬁre propagation over large time periods, timeresolved ﬁre-spread predictions are needed for active ﬁre management. In this work, we evaluate the ability of deep learning approaches in accurately modeling the timeresolved dynamics of wildﬁres. We use an autoregressive process in which a convolutional recurrent deep learning model makes predictions that propagate a wildﬁre over 15 min increments. We apply the model to four simulated datasets of increasing complexity, containing both ﬁeld ﬁres with homogeneous fuel distribution as well as realworld topologies sampled from the California region of the United States. We show that even after 100 autoregressive predictions representing more than 24 h of simulated ﬁre spread, the resulting models generate stable and realistic propagation dynamics, achieving a Jaccard score between 0.89 and 0.94 when predicting the resulting ﬁre scar. The inference time of the deep learning models are examined and compared, and directions for future work are discussed.},

For this, a recent direct numerical simulation database of a reacting hydrogen/air jet-in-cross-ﬂow (JICF) by Grout et al. [15,16] is used. The full ﬂamelet equation for temperature, exact to the order of the Eulerian transport equation and general to different deﬁnitions of the mixture fraction, is derived. Analysis of mixture fraction conditioned proﬁles of temperature and scalar dissipation rate along the jet trajectory identiﬁed different ignition and ﬂame stabilization scenarios on the windward and leeward sides of the reacting JICF. A balance analysis of the temperature ﬂamelet equation is conducted to quantify contributions in ﬂame-aligned and ﬂame-orthogonal directions. Consistent with the ﬂamelet assumption, it is shown that terms arising from scalar diffusion, heat-release, and species-diffusioninduced enthalpy ﬂux are the dominant contributions, while the ﬂame-aligned preferential diffusion promotes entrainment of heat into the ﬂamelet structure. For the current JICF-conﬁguration, it is found that contributions along the ﬂame-orthogonal direction are on average negligible.},

	abstract = {A three-stream ﬂamelet/progress variable model is applied to the Sydney piloted premixed jet burner (PPJB). Using experimental data, a prior model evaluation is performed to assess critical modeling assumptions regarding the applicability of this formulation to partially-premixed combustion, the statistical representation of the scalar mixing, and the joint PDF-closure. A Dirichlet distribution, as generalization of the beta distribution, is introduced to represent the interaction between the two mixture fractions that are associated with the fuel, pilot, and coﬂow streams. Comparisons with experimental data are performed to demonstrate the accuracy of this closure-model. Following this prior model evaluation, the three-stream combustion model is applied to large-eddy simulation, and calculations of all four burner conﬁgurations, designated as PM1-\{50, 100, 150, 200\}, are performed. Through comparisons with experimental data and equilibrium computations it was found that the ﬂow-ﬁeld is sensitive to the scalar inﬂow composition, and scalar boundary conditions consistent with experimental measurements were used for all simulations. The effect of wall heat-losses on the temperature and species proﬁles is assessed in an approximate way, suggesting that species proﬁles are unaffected by the heat-transfer between pilot and coﬂow streams. Comparisons of statistical results and thermo-chemical correlations show that the model is capable of predicting ﬂow-ﬁeld, temperature, and major species proﬁles. The simulations over-predict the fuel-consumption for PM1-150 and PM1-200, which has also been observed in previous investigations. Aspects regarding model extensions to account for heat-losses and transient extinction/ re-ignition processes are discussed.},

	abstract = {This article is concerned with the numerical simulation of high-speed thermally perfect flows using high-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. In these methods, the polynomial approximation of the solution is susceptible to spurious oscillations, especially in high-gradient regions. The introduction of variable thermodynamic properties, important for hypersonic flows, can exacerbate this issue. Given the general lack of satisfactory high-order DG simulations of these types of flows, our primary objective is to demonstrate the success of the formulation proposed here in computing flows in this regime. Secondary goals are to (a) highlight that DG schemes are significantly less sensitive than finite-volume methods to mesh-shock misalignment in the given setting and (b) evaluate the sensitivity of surface heating predictions to various types of no-slip isothermal wall boundary conditions. To handle strong shocks prevalent in this flow regime, intra-element solution variations are used to detect discontinuities and smooth artificial viscosity is employed for stabilization. We discuss the algorithmic developments for extending a standard DG discretization of the compressible Navier–Stokes equations with the calorically perfect gas model to the thermally perfect gas model. We apply the resulting DG formulation to several hypersonic test cases, including inviscid flow over a cylinder and viscous flow over a double cone. Where appropriate, our results are benchmarked against those obtained with state-of-the-art finite-volume hypersonic flow solvers. The final case entails high-speed particle-laden flow over a blunt body. The results of this test illuminate how the consideration of variable thermodynamic properties influences the prediction of the particle phase.},

	abstract = {High-pressure conditions in diesel engines can often surpass the thermodynamic critical limit of the working fluid. Consequently, the injection of fuel at these conditions can lead to complex behaviors that remain only incompletely understood. This study is concerned with investigating the application of a diffuse-interface method in conjunction with a finite-rate chemistry model in large-eddy simulations of diesel spray injection and ignition in a supercritical ambient environment. The presented numerical approach offers the capability of simulating these complex conditions without the need for parameter tuning that is commonly employed in spray-breakup models. Numerical simulations of inert and reacting n-dodecane sprays — under the Engine Combustion Network Spray A and Spray D configurations — are studied, and results are compared with experimental data for liquid/vapor penetration lengths and ignition timing. In addition, parametric studies are performed to identify flow sensitivities arising from the variation in nozzle diameters between both injectors, along with the impact of low-temperature oxidation on ignition in Spray D simulations. Spray A simulations are found to be insensitive to turbulence, and predictions for penetration length and ignition behavior are in good agreement with experiments. In contrast, Spray D predictions for penetration length and ignition delay demonstrated significant sensitivities to in-nozzle turbulence, introducing uncertainty to the predicted results and stipulating the need for quantitative measurements for model evaluation.},

	abstract = {Many state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) fields rely on large datasets and massive deep learning models (with (109) trainable parameters) to predict target variables accurately without overfitting. Within combustion, a wealth of data exists in the form of high-fidelity simulation data and detailed measurements that have been accumulating since the past decade. Yet, this data remains distributed and can be difficult to access. In this work, we present a realistic and feasible framework which combines (i) community involvement, (ii) public data repositories, and (iii) lossy compression algorithms for enabling broad access to high-fidelity data via a network-of-datasets approach. This Bearable Large Accessible Scientific Training Network-ofDatasets (BLASTNet) is consolidated on a community-hosted web-platform (at https://blastnet.github.io/), and is targeted towards improving accessibility to diverse scientific data for deep learning algorithms. For datasets that exceed the storage limitations in public ML repositories, we propose employing lossy compression algorithms on high-fidelity data, at the cost of introducing controllable amounts of error to the data. This framework leverages the well-known robustness of modern deep learning methods to noisy data, which we demonstrate is also applicable in combustion by training deep learning models on lossy direct numerical simulation (DNS) data in two completely different ML problems — one in combustion regime classification and the other in filtered reaction rate regression. Our results show that combustion DNS data can be compressed by at least 10-fold without affecting deep learning models, and that the resulting lossy errors can even improve their training. We thus call on the research community to help contribute to opening a bearable pathway towards accessible big data in combustion.},

	abstract = {Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engines promise better efficiency and cleaner emissions than conventional piston engines, but can be challenging to control. Rapid compression machines (RCM) provide a simplified configuration for investigating HCCI combustion behavior, which is necessary for effective control of engine ignition timing and peak pressures. In this study, we assess the utility of large eddy simulations (LES) for predicting HCCI combustion in a 3-D configuration. To this end, LES with finiterate chemistry employing a 99-species iso-octane/air mechanism of two RCM operating conditions are performed. The RCM configuration under consideration was designed by Strozzi et al. (Combust. Flame, 2019) with a flat piston to introduce large amounts of thermal stratification representative of realistic HCCI engine conditions, through the generation of corner vortices. It is shown that the simulation provides reasonable agreement with temperature fluctuations (7\% difference), as well as ignition delay in the short ignition case (1 ms difference), while the long ignition case (35 ms difference) highlights more substantial deficiencies that are still within the expected uncertainty from the employed chemical mechanism. Flame propagation modes predicted by LES agree with experimental observations: spontaneous ignition is seen in the short ignition case, while deflagration is more prominent in the long ignition case. Analysis of global and local quantities classify the short ignition case in a mixed ignition regime, and the long ignition case in the mild ignition regime. These results demonstrate the utility of FRC-LES for investigations of multimode combustion regimes of HCCI combustion in a 3-D configuration.},

To this end, three-dimensional Lagrangian flamelet structures are extracted and the temporal evolution of the mixture fraction conditioned profiles of temperature, heat release rate and scalar dissipation rate during the blow-out sequence are analyzed in detail.

Further, the theory of XCT measurements applied to combustion systems is developed and implemented to arrive at 3D implied temperature field measurements at high spatial resolution. Implied temperature results are shown to exhibit quantitative agreement with those of a known 1D volume-averaged model for porous media combustion as well as with standard thermocouple measurements. These results shed light on internal thermophysical processes within PMBs while demonstrating the significant potential of XCT in obtaining quantitative, spatially resolved field data within optically inaccessible combustion environments.},

	abstract = {Moderate or intense low oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion has been the subject of numerous studies in recent years. An issue remains, however, in the definition of the boundaries of the MILD combustion regime with respect to non-premixed configurations without predefined reference temperatures. A flamelet definition is applied to non-premixed configurations to better understand the MILD combustion regime and classify previous experimental investigations. Through a simplified analysis, a new definition for the non-premixed MILD combustion regime is derived. This new definition is a function of initial and final temperatures, and the effective activation energy of an equivalent one-step chemical reaction. This inherently agrees with the features of the premixed flamelet definition and provides insight into previous attempts to reconcile premixed and non-premixed classifications of MILD combustion. Previously studied turbulent flames are classified using the new definition of MILD combustion and are compared to experimental observations. The new definition of MILD combustion is subsequently compared to the ignition characteristics of opposed-flow ethylene flames, showing good agreement. Finally, transient flamelets are solved for a modelled flow-field to successfully reproduce non-monotonic trends in the lift-off that is observed experimentally in a series of MILD and autoignitive, turbulent ethylene flames in hot, diluted coflows.},

A series of simulations are presented with varying solid conduction and inlet velocity to isolate the role of conjugate heat transfer on the salient features of the burner, including flame stability, axial temperature profiles, and flame structure. We show that both the flame stabilization and the propagation behavior are strongly related to the conjugate heat transfer, and the flame stability regime is shifted to higher velocities as the conductivity of the solid material is increased.},

	abstract = {Because the numerical simulation of soot production in turbulent flames is quite challenging, it is useful to consider simpler aerodynamic configurations retaining unsteady strain rate and curvature effects. The present article reports detailed numerical simulations of a planar vortex interacting with a sooting laminar diffusion flame formed by a parallel flow of acetylene and air. Calculations are carried out to reproduce the experimental data reported by Cetegen and Basu (2006). Compared to previous numerical works on this configuration based on simple two-equations soot models, a detailed numerical mechanism, accounting for 97 gaseous species and 59 solid BINs, is considered here to represent the chemistry in the gas phase and the production and oxidation of soot particles. Three different vortex strengths are considered and vortices are formed by pulsing the air or the fuel streams, allowing comparisons between the calculated soot-vortexflame interactions with LII images. Calculations adequately retrieve experimental data when the vortex is initiated at the fuel side. Differences are observed when the vortex is formed on the air side. The simulations, however, are useful for examining strain rate and curvature effects on soot volume fractions of small spherical particles and large aggregates, and to study physical processes underlying the soot production. It is shown that the variability of the soot volume fraction is highly correlated to the response of soot precursors to flame curvature. Soot variability in the mixture fraction space depends on the behavior of large aggregates that, being characterized by high Schmidt numbers, are more sensitive to the convective motion imposed by the vortex compared to the gaseous phase. The observed behavior has to be reproduced by the models developed for numerical simulations in order to obtain an accurate prediction of soot production in turbulent flames.},

	abstract = {Electron tomography (ET) imaging provides nanometer-scale measurements of the structure of solid samples. ET, with an appropriate reconstruction workflow, provides significant insight into a variety of shale properties including structure, fluid transport and reaction. Despite the advantageous high resolution, the tomographic reconstruction of a three-dimensional (3D) structure from multiple 2D projections presents several challenges. In particular, because of the limited transmission of electrons through the sample, the signal to noise ratio remains small and the projection range is restricted to only a partial set of angles (±60° tilt angle). This missing wedge of angles results in tomographic artifacts that deteriorate the quality of the reconstructed volume, thereby compromising the accurate characterization of the nanometer-scale network of pores. To address these challenges, this study evaluates quantitatively the capabilities of ET. This work sits at the intersection of two disciplines: unconventional reservoir evaluation and computational imaging. It is the first of its kind to offer a comparison of the robustness of ET reconstruction methods applied to a shale thin section. Specifically, the properties of an organic pore network are compared over different reconstruction algorithms. First, Fourier techniques (Weighted Back-Projection, Filtered Back-Projection) and iterative techniques (Conjugate Gradient Least Squares, Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique) are used to reconstruct the structure of a Barnett shale sample. The pore network inside of and around a region of organic matter is visualized in 3D. Comparisons between the different reconstruction methods highlight the variability observed in regions with small pores. This variability is then quantified by comparing values of storage and transport metrics over the different methods. Finally, synthetic numerical phantoms and model samples are used to illustrate the limitations of the method and quantify the effect of artifacts. It is found that a strong agreement is observed for large pores over the different ET reconstruction workflows considered while a wider variability exists for small features. As a result, even though ET can provide robust estimates of the porosity of shale samples, the accurate determination of connectivity and transport metrics remains challenging due to missing wedge artifacts and noise limitations. The results suggest that application of ET to such samples benefits from artifact-reduction techniques. Experimental reduction in the missing wedge, and advanced reconstruction methods that fill-in the missing information, represent promising opportunities to characterize more accurately pore network properties in shale samples.},

Reasons for this are the usage of averaged properties of fuel-components and the lack of data for physical properties of fuel components -- especially for cycloparaffins and substituted aromatics which form a significant portion of the mixture. We present an approach based solely on functional groups that are present in the components of the fuel. In the description of the multicomponent evaporation, we incorporate a non-ideal evaporation formulation while still providing computationally efficient calculations. This allows the evaluation of evaporation and combustion characteristics of virtually any fuel blend based only on the intrinsic primary and secondary functional groups. Studies of various fuel blends and surrogates, including Jet-A, JP-8 and gasoline are performed and results are compared against experimental data. Due to the generalized nature of this approach, the proposed method provides an effective alternative for existing computational techniques dedicated to multicomponent droplet evaporation; further work involving the utilization of this approach in various combustion codes can be performed.},

	abstract = {Transportation fuels consist of a large number of species that belong to different families of compounds. Predictions of physical and chemical properties of such multicomponent fuels require the accurate description of evaporation rates of all species initially contained in the liquid phase. Existing computational approaches are yet to do this without difﬁculty due to the lack of experimental data for physical properties of fuel components. In addition, a vast number of assumptions, which include idealized compositions and interpolation equations calibrated using experiments, are being introduced to make the problem tractable. By addressing this issue, an approach based solely on functional groups that are present in the components of the fuel is developed. This formulation is coupled to a multicomponent evaporation model to account for non-ideal behavior of mixtures and the consideration of pressure and temperature variations. This is done by using the fuel composition to evaluate the acentric factor and critical properties of each fuel component followed by the evaluation of certain physical properties using a group contribution method. This procedure thus allows the evaluation of evaporation rates of practical fuels based only on the intrinsic functional groups and their relative abundance. Studies of common fuel blends including those belonging to the Jet-A and JP-8 classes related to evaporation rates, distillation characteristics and speciation are presented. A discussion of the effect of polar species on evaporation properties utilizing the UNIFAC approach for non-ideal mixtures is presented. Due to the generalized nature of this approach, the proposed method provides an effective alternative to existing computational techniques dedicated to multicomponent droplet evaporation.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effect of turbulence on the ignition of multicomponent surrogate fuels and its role in modifying preferential evaporation in multiphase turbulent spray environments. To this end, two zerodimensional droplet models are considered that are representative of asymptotic conditions of diffusion limit and the distillation limit are considered. The coupling between diffusion, evaporation and combustion is first identified using a scale analysis of 0D homogeneous batch reactor simulations. Subsequently, direct numerical simulations of homogeneously dispersed multicomponent droplets are performed for both droplet models, in decaying isotropic turbulence and at quiescent conditions to examine competing time scale effects arising from evaporation, ignition and turbulence. Results related to intra-droplet transport and effects of turbulence on autoignition and overall combustion are studied using an aviation fuel surrogate. Depending on the characteristic scale, it is shown that turbulence can couple through modulation of evaporation time or defer the ignition phase as a result of droplet cooling or gas-phase homogenization. Both preferential evaporation and turbulence are found to modify the ignition delay time, up to a factor of two. More importantly, identical droplet ignition behavior in homogeneous gas phase can imply fundamentally different combustion modes in heterogeneous environments.},

An adaptive mesh reﬁnement (AMR) algorithm in conjunction with a detailed chemistry representation is used to resolve physically relevant features such as the viscous boundary layer, the shock bifurcation region, and ignition kernels. The simulations employ a second-order accurate Navier–Stokes equations solver that is modiﬁed to include ﬁnite-rate reaction chemistry, wall-heat transfer, and detailed mass, thermal, and viscous-diﬀusion-transport properties. The operating conditions considered in this study span the thermodynamic state-space in the weak and strong ignition regimes. The treatment of wall-heat transfer is found to signiﬁcantly alter the characteristics of ignition. The computations show that the mixing of the thermally stratiﬁed ﬂuid, which carries diﬀerent momentum and enthalpy, introduces inhomogeneities in the core region behind the reﬂected shock. These inhomogeneities act as localized ignition kernels. During the induction period, these kernels slowly expand and eventually transition to a detonation wave, rapidly consuming the unburned mixture. Eﬀects of the reaction chemistry on the ignition behavior are examined by considering two diﬀerent reaction mechanisms. A detailed analysis is performed to show that the transition from ignition kernel to detonation is well described by the SWACER mechanism.},

	abstract = {Rotating detonation engines combust reactive gas mixtures with a high-speed, annularlypropagating detonation wave. They provide several advantages over conventional combustors including a stagnation pressure gain and a compact, lightweight design. However, the requirement to premix the inlet fuel and oxidizer streams leads to an inhomogeneous ﬂow, which is posited to decrement the wave speed from the theoretical Chapman-Jouget value and affect the stable operation of rotating detonation engines. Hence, it is the focus of this work to apply high-ﬁdelity large-eddy simulation techniques and low-order modeling to examine the mixing properties of a representative rotating detonation engine’s inlet. For the numerical simulation, a sharp mixing elbow conﬁguration is employed, and prevalent recirculation regions are examined; furthermore, the mixing inhomogeneity and stagnation pressure losses are quantiﬁed. The effect of inlet mixing on the combustion within the rotating detonation engine is examined using a low-order model. From this low-order model, the induction lengths and wave velocities of the detonation wave are analyzed.},

Machine learning enables the critical evaluation of combustion regimes from disparate sources and allows for a generalized comparison of the parameters. The parameter set is composed of features that have been found to be effective in classifying ignition regimes and are supposed to have a universality in predicting the regularity of the ignition process. Three different conﬁgurations are examined: weak ignition shock tubes, mild ignition in rapid compression machines, and the regularity of cellular detonations. All conﬁgurations are demonstrated to show a strong sensitivity to the heat deposition time of the chemical reaction. Additionally, detonations are found to be primarily sensitive to the heat release and show that an increased chemical sensitivity has a regularizing effect when plotted against the heat release rate. The data are found to be well classiﬁed with only one or two parameters, indicating that a universal, governing parameter is plausible.},

	abstract = {An ignition time model is developed to model super knock in a compression engine. The model assumes that thermoacoustic interaction is the primary mechanism for the onset of super knock. By ignoring diffusive effects, a simple transport equation for the time to ignition of a fluid particle is derived. The significantly reduced cost of the chemistry model allows for complex hydrocarbon fuels to be simulated. Additionally, a zonal model for the secondary ignition of a charge due to the action of an expanding flame is developed. The flame compresses the unburned gas, causing the temperature and pressure to rise, which yields a preignition in the unburned gas before the charge is engulfed by the flame. It is shown that the ignition time model compares well to the detailed chemical model with less than 1\% difference in the prediction of ignition delay. Using this ignition time model, a multi-dimensional simulation of super knock in a rapid compression machine corresponding to the configuration of Wang et al. [1] is performed. It is found that interaction of the shock with the flame and the side wall of the cylinder significantly enhances the strength of the shock, and the in-cylinder pressure exceeds 300 bar. From the pressure rise predicted by the simulation, it is concluded that simulated ignition is a super knock event. Since the ignition time model excludes diffusive effects on the chemistry, it is proposed that acoustic resonance of the cylinder is the primary driver in the development of super knock for the configuration under examination and that inhomogeneous ignition due to transient flame compression could be a key mechanism for super knock.},

	abstract = {Regimes of shock boundary layer interaction are proposed in consideration of shock tube kinetic experiments. For this, we examine three ways that the reflected shock wave interacts with the boundary layer: incipient separation occurs when the shock is just strong enough to subject the flow to an adverse pressure gradient leading to flow reversal; shear layer instabilities manifest after a certain length of time and can cause inhomogeneities in the test gas; and shock bifurcation occurs when the back pressure of the test gas is sufficient to contain the boundary layer fluid within a stagnation bubble causing severe inhomogeneities in the test gas. Theory delineating these regimes is developed, and these delineations are compared to simulations of shock tube experiments as well as experimental data, where reasonable agreement is found. Through the theory applied to the incipient separation regime, it is determined that boundary layer separation likely occurs in most shock tube experiments; however, separation is unlikely to affect a chemical kinetic experiment except at long test times. To quantify the effect of the boundary layer, a bifurcation Damköhler number is introduced, which is found to perform sensibly well at classifying strong and weak ignition in shock tubes, implying that these combustion phenomena are determined by a competition of physical and chemical timescales. Finally, simulations suggest that tailoring the incident shock Mach number for a given experiment could provide opportunities for mitigating inhomogeneities in the test gas.},

	abstract = {Enhanced ﬂuctuations, steep gradients, and intensiﬁed heat transfer are characteristics of wall-bounded turbulence at transcritical conditions. Although such conditions are prevalent in numerous technical applications, the structure of the thermal boundary layer under realistic density gradients and heating conditions remains poorly understood. Speciﬁcally, statistical descriptions of the temperature ﬁeld in such ﬂows are provided inconsistently using existing models. To address this issue, direct numerical simulations are performed by considering fully developed transcritical turbulent channel ﬂow at pressure and temperature conditions that cause density changes of a factor of up to O(20) between the hot and cold walls. As a consequence of the proximity of the Widom line to the hot wall, signiﬁcant asymmetries are observed when comparing regions near the cold wall and near the hot wall. Previous transformations that attempt to collapse the near-wall mean temperature proﬁles among different cases to a single curve are examined. By addressing model deﬁciencies of these transformations, a formulation for an improved mean temperature transformation is proposed, with appropriate considerations for real ﬂuid effects that involve strong variations in thermodynamic quantities. Our proposed transformation is shown to perform well in collapsing the slope of the logarithmic region to a single universal value with reduced uncertainty. Coupled with a predictive framework to estimate the non-universal shift parameter of the logarithmic region using a priori information, our transformation provides an analytic proﬁle to model the near-wall mean temperature. These results thus provide a framework to guide the development of models for wall-bounded transcritical turbulence.},

In this concept, the fuel is injected through a coannular duct, resulting in increased fuel-air mixing and minimized formation of soot and other unwanted combustion products. Apart from comprehensive experimental investigations on DFI, so far computational studies have been limited to single-point Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes simulations. Therefore, the objective of this work is to complement these studies by performing large-eddy simulations using a diffuse-interface method to examine the physical mechanisms and combustion processes of DFI, specifically focusing on the mixing process and the effect of fuel-ducting on combustion and pollutant emissions. To this end, finite-rate chemistry simulations are performed of the DFI configuration corresponding to the Engine Combustion Network Spray A injector at transcritical conditions (n-dodecane fuel, 60 bar pressure and 1000 K temperature chamber conditions). A two-equation soot model is employed for the qualitative analysis of soot emissions. Direct comparisons of averaged and instantaneous flow field results with the Spray A configuration are performed to assess the effect of DFI on the first- and second-stage ignition and soot formation. Compared to the free-spray condition, the results show that the DFI case exhibits a combination of (i) increased mass flow rate and entrained air, (ii) larger pressure drop magnitude and flow velocity, and (iii) a closer-to-stoichiometric mixture composition (both globally and locally), each of which is conjectured to contribute toward reduced soot production.},

This hierarchy is based on a Reynolds stress anisotropy transport equation that is modeled from the exact transport equation for the anisotropy. The hierarchy of models includes a recentlydeveloped non-equilibrium model, which is shown to be in good agreement with more computationally-complex fully differential models. Using this hierarchical approach, the flow physics addressed by each closure is identified and closure accuracy is shown to depend on the degree to which non-equilibrium turbulent flow effects are captured. We examine the evolution of the turbulence kinetic energy, Reynolds stresses, and anisotropy as a function of the degree of non-equilibrium in the flow, which is parameterized by the ratio of characteristic turbulence and mean-flow deformation time scales. By comparing model results to results obtained from rapid distortion theory and higher level closures, prescriptions are provided for the applicability of different closure models based on the magnitude of the non-equilibrium parameter. The theoretical analysis is complemented by comparisons of simulation results with previously established direct numerical simulations for a one-dimensional compression. Finally, we connect these prescriptions with experimental measurements of turbulent and mean-flow time scales for internal combustion engines operating at realistic conditions.},

	abstract = {With the increasing interest in utilizing syngas in gas turbine applications, the characterization of H2/CO combustion and reaction chemistry under high-pressure and moderate-temperature operating conditions has been the focus of recent investigations. Different chemical-kinetics and hydrodynamic processes have been identiﬁed as being responsible for the discrepancies between experimental measurements and kinetic predictions of syngas ignition delay times. This contribution complements previous studies, and provides improved understanding about the role of turbulence and ﬂuctuations in temperature and mixture composition on the syngas combustion process in rapid compression machines (RCMs). To this end, a self-contained model is developed that describes the ignition and combustion process by considering the interaction between turbulence, detailed reaction chemistry, and wall heat loss effects. Different mechanisms can be identiﬁed as being responsible for the generation of inhomogeneities in ﬂow-ﬁeld, temperature, and mixture composition, including turbulence-generation during the ﬁlling process, corner vortices, wall-generated turbulence, and mixing between ﬂuid in the core region and the boundary layer. In the present model, these contributions are parametrically represented in terms of initial turbulence levels, and the mean-strain ampliﬁcation of these perturbations during the compression phase is described using rapid distortion theory. The model is applied to different syngas mixtures and operating conditions, including pressures up to 20 atm and temperatures between 600 and 1300 K. Parametric studies show that the model captures experimentally observed trends of reduced ignition delay and prolonged reaction progress during the ignition phase. A Damköhler criterion is proposed in order to characterize the sensitivity of the induction chemistry to turbulence ﬂuctuations. Results suggest that syngas mixtures with Damköhler numbers below 50 exhibit increasing sensitivity to turbulence and mixture ﬂuctuations. This parametric study indicates that the turbulence/chemistry interaction can play an equally important role in affecting the syngas ignition chemistry, and requires consideration in addition to chemical-kinetics and hydrodynamic processes previously identiﬁed as leading mechanisms for the observed discrepancy in syngas ignition.},

Optimization is performed using a mixed variable extension to the generalized pattern search method. This method offers the advantage that categorical variables, such as neural transfer functions and nodal connectivities, can be used as parameters in optimization. When used together with a surrogate, the resulting algorithm is highly efficient for expensive objective functions. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in optimizing an ANN for the number of neurons, the type of transfer function, and the connectivity among neurons. The optimization method is applied to a chemistry approximation of practical relevance. In this application, temperature and a chemical source term are approximated as functions of two independent parameters using optimal ANNs. Comparison of the performance of optimal ANNs with conventional tabulation methods demonstrates equivalent accuracy by considerable savings in memory storage. The architecture of the optimal ANN for the approximation of the chemical source term consists of a fully connected feedforward network having four nonlinear hidden layers and 117 synaptic weights. An equivalent representation of the chemical source term using tabulation techniques would require a 500 × 500 grid point discretization of the parameter space.},

	abstract = {Previously conducted studies of the ﬂamelet/progress variable model for the prediction of nonpremixed turbulent combustion processes identiﬁed two areas for model improvements: the modeling of the presumed probability density function (PDF) for the reaction progress parameter and the consideration of unsteady effects [Ihme et al., Proc. Combust. Inst. 30 (2005) 793]. These effects are of particular importance during local ﬂame extinction and subsequent reignition. Here, the models for the presumed PDFs for conserved and reactive scalars are re-examined and a statistically most likely distribution (SMLD) is employed and tested in a priori studies using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data and experimental results from the Sandia ﬂame series. In the ﬁrst part of the paper, the SMLD model is employed for a reactive scalar distribution. Modeling aspects of the a priori PDF, accounting for the bias in composition space, are discussed. The convergence of the SMLD with increasing number of enforced moments is demonstrated. It is concluded that information about more than two moments is beneﬁcial to accurately represent the reactive scalar distribution in turbulent ﬂames with strong extinction and reignition. In addition to the reactive scalar analysis, the potential of the SMLD for the representation of conserved scalar distributions is also analyzed. In the a priori study using DNS data it is found that the conventionally employed beta distribution provides a better representation for the scalar distribution. This is attributed to the fact that the beta-PDF implicitly enforces higher moment information that is in excellent agreement with the DNS data. However, the SMLD outperforms the beta distribution in free shear ﬂow applications, which are typically characterized by strongly skewed scalar distributions, in the case where higher moment information can be enforced.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) of the Sydney bluﬀ-body swirl-stabilized methane–hydrogen ﬂame are performed, employing two chemistry representation methods, namely a conventional structured tabulation technique and artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs). A generalized method for the generation of optimal artiﬁcial networks (OANNs) has been proposed by Ihme et al. [M. Ihme, A.L. Marsden, H. Pitsch, Neural Comput. 20 (2) (2008) 573–601]. This method is, for the ﬁrst time, applied in LES of turbulent reactive ﬂows, guaranteeing an optimal chemistry representation with error control, which was previously not possible. The network performance with respect to accuracy, data retrieval time, and storage requirements is compared with the structured tabulation of increasing resolution, and eﬀects of long-time error accumulation on the statistical results during a numerical simulation are discussed. Using the optimization algorithm, it is demonstrated that ANN accuracies can be achieved which are comparable with structured tables of moderate to ﬁne resolution. Furthermore, it is shown that for a comparable number of synaptic weights, the network ﬁtness increases with increasing number of hidden layers. Compared to the tabulation technique, data retrieval from the network is computationally more expensive; however, the additional overhead associated with the ANN evaluation remains acceptable in LES applications. Results for ﬂow ﬁeld statistics and scalar quantities which are obtained from LES are in good agreement with experimental data, and possible reasons for the diﬀerences between computed and measured temperature proﬁles near the bluﬀ-body are discussed. The diﬀerence in the velocity statistics between simulations employing structured table and network representation are small, and deviations in the CO2 proﬁles on the fuel-rich side of the ﬂame are mainly attributed to the sensitivity of CO2 with respect to changes in progress variable.},

The ﬁltered chemical source term in this model appears in unclosed form, and is modeled by a presumed probability density function (PDF) for the joint PDF of the mixture fraction Z and a ﬂamelet parameter k. While the marginal PDF of Z can be reasonably approximated by a beta distribution, a model for the conditional PDF of the ﬂamelet parameter needs to be developed. Further, the ability of FPVA to predict extinction and re-ignition has also not been assessed. In this paper, we address these aspects of the model using the DNS database of Sripakagorn et al. It is ﬁrst shown that the steady ﬂamelet assumption in the context of FPVA leads to good predictions even for high levels of local extinction. Three diﬀerent models for the conditional PDF of the ﬂamelet parameter are tested in an a priori sense. Results obtained using a delta function to model the conditional PDF of k lead to an overprediction of the mean temperature, even with only moderate extinction levels. It is shown that if the conditional PDF of k is modeled by a beta distribution conditioned on Z, then FPVA can predict extinction and re-ignition eﬀects, and good agreement between the model and DNS data for the mean temperature is observed.

	abstract = {A model for the prediction of the nitric oxide (NO) formation in turbulent nonpremixed flames is proposed. Since the NO formation has a strong temperature sensitivity, the accurate prediction of the flame temperature under the consideration of radiative heat losses is required. The first part of the paper addresses the extension of a flamelet-based combustion model to account for radiative heat loss effects by introducing enthalpy as an additional parameter. A transport equation for enthalpy is solved, and the radiative sink term in this equation is obtained from unsteady flamelet solutions. The model is applied to a large-eddy simulation (LES) of Sandia flame D, and the importance of the interaction between turbulence and radiation on temperature and mixture fraction is investigated. Based on the radiative flamelet formulation, a consistent model for the prediction of NO formation is developed in the second part of the paper. In this model, an additional transport equation for the NO mass fraction is solved, and the chemical source term is obtained from a flamelet library. Since the consumption rate is dependent on the NO mass fraction, this term requires modeling, which is discussed in this paper. By employing a scale similarity argument, a closure model for application in LES is presented. After the analysis of the proposed model for the thermal, nitrous oxide, and prompt pathways for NO formation, the NO model is integrated into the extended flamelet/progress variable model and applied in LES of Sandia flame D and a Pratt \& Whitney aircraft engine combustor configuration.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) of a jet issuing into a hot and diluted coﬂow are performed. To model this three-stream burner conﬁguration, which is operated in the moderate and intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion regime, a ﬂamelet/progress variable (FPV) formulation is extended by introducing an additional conserved scalar. This additional scalar is associated with the oxidizer split, and is used to identify ﬂamelets of diﬀerent mixture composition. Due to the extended spatial structure of this jet diﬀusion ﬂame, the moderate Reynolds number, and the overall lean operating condition, diﬀerent ﬂamelets interact only weakly in mixture composition space, so that the thermochemical state-space is populated from the solution of the one-dimensional ﬂamelet equations. To account for the turbulence/chemistry interaction on numerically unresolved scales, a presumed probability density function (PDF) is used in the LES combustion model. This three-stream FPV combustion model is applied in LES of the MILD combustor, which was experimentally investigated by Dally et al. (2002) [4]. The comparison with results obtained from the single-mixture fraction FPV formulation shows that the coﬂow mixture composition can only inadequately be represented by a single mixture fraction, resulting in a signiﬁcant overprediction of the ﬂame temperature and CO mass fraction. The second part of this work addresses the sensitivity of the ﬂow ﬁeld and ﬂame structure to the speciﬁcation of scalar inﬂow conditions under kinetics-controlled, low-Damko¨ hler number combustion conditions. To this end, LES calculations are performed that employ an increasing level of ﬁdelity in the speciﬁcation of the scalar boundary conditions, including homogeneous and intermittent turbulent scalar inﬂow conditions that are derived from experimental data. From this analysis, it is shown that the consideration of turbulent ﬂuctuations in the scalar composition leads to improved predictions for temperature and mass fractions of CO and OH. Furthermore, the results from this simulation also suggest that eﬀects of scalar inﬂow conditions are not only conﬁned to the nozzle-near region but extend throughout the entire ﬂame. It is anticipated that these ﬁndings could also be of relevance to other simulations of kinetics-controlled and low-temperature combustion systems, including autoignition, lifted ﬂames, and premixed systems in which ﬂames are stabilized by vitiated and hot coﬂows.},

Contributions from the acoustic sources due to Reynolds stresses and fluctuating mass flux are found to be virtually insignificant at low frequencies. Discrepancies in the prediction of high-frequency sound pressure level in the jet forward direction were analyzed and are attributed to high-frequency acoustic refraction effects due to variations in sound speed.

	abstract = {The implementation of advanced low-emission aircraft engine technologies and the reduction of noise from airframe, fan, and jet exhaust have made noise contributions from an engine core increasingly important. Therefore, meeting future ambitious noise-reduction goals requires the consideration of engine-core noise. This article reviews progress on the fundamental understanding, experimental analysis, and modeling of engine-core noise; addresses limitations of current techniques; and identiﬁes opportunities for future research. After identifying core-noise contributions from the combustor, turbomachinery, nozzles, and jet exhaust, they are examined in detail. Contributions from direct combustion noise, originating from unsteady combustion, and indirect combustion noise, resulting from the interaction of ﬂow-ﬁeld perturbations with mean-ﬂow variations in turbine stages and nozzles, are analyzed. A new indirect noise-source contribution arising from mixture inhomogeneities is identiﬁed by extending the theory. Although typically omitted in core-noise analysis, the impact of mean-ﬂow variations and nozzle-upstream perturbations on the jet-noise modulation is examined, providing potential avenues for future core-noise mitigation.},

	title = {Computational {Modeling} and {Analysis} of {Diesel}-fuel {Injection} and {Autoignition} at {Transcritical} {Conditions}},
	abstract = {The need for improved engine efficiencies has motivated the development of high-pressure combustion systems, in which operating conditions achieve and exceed critical conditions. Associated with these conditions are strong variations in thermo-transport properties as the fluid undergoes phase transition, and two-stage ignition with low-temperature combustion. Accurately simulating these physical phenomena at real-fluid environments remains a challenge. By addressing this issue, a high-fidelity LES-modeling framework is developed to conduct simulations of transcritical fuel spray mixing and autoignition at high-pressure conditions. The simulation is based on a recently developed diffused interface method that solves the compressible multi-species conservation equations along with a Peng-Robinson state equation and real-fluid transport properties. LES analysis is performed for non-reacting and reacting spray conditions targeting the ECN Spray A configuration at chamber conditions with a pressure of 60 bar and temperatures between 900 K and 1200 K to investigate effects of the real-fluid environment and low-temperature chemistry. Comparisons with measurements in terms of global spray parameters (i.e., liquid and vapor penetration lengths) are shown to be in good agreement. Analysis of the mixture fraction distributions in the dispersed spray region demonstrates the accuracy in modelling the turbulent mixing behavior. Good agreement of the ignition delay time and the lift-off length is obtained from simulation results at different ambient temperature conditions and the formation of intermediate species is captured by the simulations, indicating that the presented numerical framework adequately reproduces the corresponding low- and high-temperature ignition processes under high-pressure conditions, whichare relevant to realistic diesel-fuel injection systems.},

	abstract = {Large eddy simulations of transcritical injection and auto-ignition of n-dodecane in a combustion chamber are performed. To this end, a diffuse-interface method is employed that solves the compressible multi-species conservation equations, and a cubic state equation together with real-fluid transport properties is employed to describe the transcritical fluid state. The reaction chemistry is represented by a finite-rate chemistry model involving a 33-species reduced mechanism for n-dodecane. Compared to commonly employed two-phase approaches, the method presented in this work does not introduce tunable parameters for spray-breakup. Large eddy simulation calculations are performed by considering the Spray A single-hole injector at non-reacting and reacting conditions at a pressure of 60 bar and temperatures between 800 and 1200 K. Quantitative comparisons with measurements for liquid and vapor penetration lengths are performed for non-reacting conditions, and sensitivity to threshold values on mixture fraction are examined. The analysis of reacting flow simulations focuses on comparisons of the instantaneous temperature and species fields for OH and CH2O at 800 and 900 K, respectively. Quantitative comparisons with measurements for ignition delay and lift-off heights as a function of ambient temperature are performed. To examine the transient ignition phase, comparisons of radially integrated OH profiles obtained from the simulations with reported measurements for OH* are performed, showing good agreement. These results show that the large eddy simulation modeling framework adequately reproduces the corresponding ignition processes, which are relevant to realistic diesel-fuel injection systems.},

	abstract = {Progress in combustion science and engineering has led to the generation of large amounts of data from largescale simulations, high-resolution experiments, and sensors. This corpus of data offers enormous opportunities for extracting new knowledge and insights—if harnessed effectively. Machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated remarkable success in data analytics, thus offering a new paradigm for data-intense analyses and scientific investigations through combustion machine learning (CombML). While data-driven methods are uti­ lized in various combustion areas, recent advances in algorithmic developments, the accessibility of open-source software libraries, the availability of computational resources, and the abundance of data have together rendered ML techniques ubiquitous in scientific analysis and engineering. This article examines ML techniques for ap­ plications in combustion science and engineering. Starting with a review of sources of data, data-driven tech­ niques, and concepts, we examine supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised ML methods. Various combustion examples are considered to illustrate and to evaluate these methods. Next, we review past and recent applications of ML approaches to problems in combustion, spanning fundamental combustion investigations, propulsion and energy-conversion systems, and fire and explosion hazards. Challenges unique to CombML are discussed and further opportunities are identified, focusing on interpretability, uncertainty quantification, robustness, consistency, creation and curation of benchmark data, and the augmentation of ML methods with prior combustion-domain knowledge.},

This is accomplished using large-eddy simulations of a model gas turbine combustor, operating near the LBO limit. The ﬂow ﬁeld and gas phase chemistry is solved using an unstructured Navier-Stokes solver and a ﬂamelet/progress variable formulation, respectively. Liquid spray is modeled using a polydisperse droplet injection and a Lagrangian spray evaporation model. Simulations with and without stochastic modeling of droplet breakup are performed. An analysis of the droplet Weber number indicates that large diameter droplets are above the critical Weber number and should undergo secondary breakup. The present study demonstrates that secondary droplet breakup has a signiﬁcant impact on the predicted droplet distribution and temporal evolution of the ﬂame. Due to the large computational requirements of the current simulations, an ad-hoc approach to determining the initial droplet SMD and diameter is not feasible and a secondary droplet breakup model is required to reproduce the experimental trends.},

It is shown that by assimilating experimental data, EnKF improves the prediction of the extinction and reignition dynamics observed in this flame. Subsequently, the capability of the assimilation method in evaluating the model performance is examined by considering an assimilation sequence.

To this end, an ensemble Kalman filter is employed to assimilate velocity measurements of a turbulent jet at a Reynolds number of 13,500 into simulations. The goal of the current work is to examine the behavior of the assimilation algorithm for state estimation of turbulent flows that are of relevance to engineering applications. This is accomplished by investigating the impact that localization, measurement uncertainties, assimilation frequency, data sparsity and ensemble size have on the estimated state vector. For the flow configuration and computational setup considered in this study an optimal value of the localization radius is identified, which minimizes the error between experimental data and state vector. The impact of experimental uncertainties on the state estimation is demonstrated to provide solution bounds on the assimilation algorithm. It is found that increasing the number of ensembles has a positive impact on the state estimation. In comparison, decreasing the assimilation frequency or reducing the experimental data available for assimilation is found to have a negative impact on the state estimation. These findings demonstrate the viability of assimilating measurements into numerical simulations to improve state estimates, to support parameter evaluations and to guide model assessments.},

This can be achieved by mixing reactants, prior to combustion, with chemically inert diluents such as cooled combustion products. In such diluted combustion systems, the ﬂame temperature decreases because of thermal ballast, limiting NOx production. This work focuses on modeling the speciﬁcs of this combustion regime in conﬁned combustors. To characterize the dilution of reactants by burnt gases, the importance of complex chemistry effects is emphasized and taken into account using a detailed chemistry tabulation approach. This approach extends the ﬂamelet/progress variable formulation by including information about the intensity of internal dilution rates and heat losses. A turbulent combustion model is then developed in a large eddy simulation (LES) framework. The combustion model is validated by considering two combustor conﬁgurations, namely an adiabatic burner and a combustor having isothermal walls – both operating under highly diluted combustion conditions. Simulation results are in good agreement with experimental data, conﬁrming the importance of detailed chemistry information and the validity of the tabulation approach to LES application to diluted combustion.},

	abstract = {Re-ignition and re-initiation mechanisms of quenched detonation waves passing over a backward facing step are investigated using a high-resolution discontinuous Galerkin method, in which the reaction chemistry is described using a detailed chemical model. A stoichiometric Hydrogen/Oxygen mixture with diﬀerent diluents (Argon and Nitrogen) is considered to assess eﬀects of the mixture composition and reactivity on the initiation process. It is found that the mixture reactivity and the spatio-temporal evolution of the diﬀracted detonation wave are critical in controlling the development of the ignition kernels, and the possible transition to detonation. Due to curvature eﬀects and the increasing shock angle, the incident shock wave transitions from a regular reﬂection to a Mach reﬂection. Through parametric studies, it is shown that for more reactive Argon-diluted mixtures, ignition ﬁrst appears behind the regular shock reﬂection, which is followed by spontaneous re-initiation through the SWACER (Shock Wave Ampliﬁcation by Coherent Energy Release) mechanism. By replacing Argon with Nitrogen, the reactivity reduces and reignition through Mach reﬂection is observed. The subsequent re-initiation is primarily controlled by ﬂame-acoustic and wave-wave interactions. Hot-spot re-initiation behind the Mach stem is not found due to the short ignition window that exists over the limited range of shock angles. A theoretical model is developed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings and to quantify the coupling among the incident shock angle, the thermodynamic state of the shock-compressed mixture, and the ignition delay. Eﬀects of viscous-diﬀusive transport are also assessed, and it is shown that the viscous dissipation at the wall promotes ignition and transition to re-initiation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for application to chemically reacting ﬂows in subsonic and supersonic regimes under the consideration of variable thermo-viscous-diffusive transport properties, detailed and stiff reaction chemistry, and shock capturing. A hybrid-ﬂux formulation is developed for treatment of the convective ﬂuxes, combining a conservative Riemann-solver and an extended double-ﬂux scheme. A computationally eﬃcient splitting scheme is proposed, in which advection and diffusion operators are solved in the weak form, and the chemically stiff substep is advanced in the strong form using a time-implicit scheme. The discretization of the viscous-diffusive transport terms follows the second form of Bassi and Rebay, and the WENO-based limiter due to Zhong and Shu is extended to multicomponent systems. Boundary conditions are developed for subsonic and supersonic ﬂow conditions, and the algorithm is coupled to thermochemical libraries to account for detailed reaction chemistry and complex transport. The resulting DG method is applied to a series of test cases of increasing physico-chemical complexity. Beginning with one- and two-dimensional multispecies advection and shock–ﬂuid interaction problems, computational eﬃciency, convergence, and conservation properties are demonstrated. This study is followed by considering a series of detonation and supersonic combustion problems to investigate the convergence-rate and the shock-capturing capability in the presence of one- and multistep reaction chemistry. The DG algorithm is then applied to diffusion-controlled deﬂagration problems. By examining convergence properties for polynomial order and spatial resolution, and comparing these with second-order ﬁnite-volume solutions, it is shown that optimal convergence is achieved and that polynomial reﬁnement provides advantages in better resolving the localized ﬂame structure and complex ﬂow-ﬁeld features associated with multidimensional and hydrodynamic/thermo-diffusive instabilities in deﬂagration and detonation systems. Comparisons with standard third- and ﬁfth-order WENO schemes are presented to illustrate the beneﬁt of the DG scheme for application to detonation and multispecies ﬂow/shock-interaction problems.},

Compared to aerodynamic ﬂow applications, in which DG methods have been successfully employed, DG simulations of chemically reacting ﬂows introduce challenges that arise from ﬂow unsteadiness, combustion, heat release, compressibility effects, shocks, and variations in thermodynamic properties. To address these challenges, algorithms are developed, including an entropy-bounded DG method, an entropyresidual shock indicator, and a new formulation of artiﬁcial viscosity. The performance and capabilities of the resulting DG method are demonstrated in several relevant applications, including shock/bubble interaction, turbulent combustion, and detonation. It is concluded that the developed DG method shows promising performance in application to multicomponent reacting ﬂows. The paper concludes with a discussion of further research needs to enable the application of DG methods to more complex reacting ﬂows.},

In the transcritical regime, the ambient condition is such that at initial time, Ts {\textless} Tc, a sharp liquid-vapor interface exists, and evaporation occurs at subcritical condition. Eventually, the surface temperature approaches the critical mixing temperature, and the evaporation process becomes supercritical, with no distinct liquid-vapor interface. Traditional methods for simulating this complex evaporation behavior employ separate formulations for the liquid and vapor phases during subcritical evaporation and a continuous formulation during supercritical evaporation. Here, we developed a holistic formulation for the simulation of transcritical evaporation that is valid for both sub- and super-critical evaporation regimes using a diffuse-interface method derived from Linear Gradient Theory. The formulation allows for direct modeling of surface tension and interface thickness during the process of interface thickening as Ts → Tc. The diffuse-interface model was employed in simulations of a nanoscale transcritical planar evaporation conﬁguration. Furthermore, the ability of the diffuse-interface model to resolve both macroscale ﬂuid behavior and nanoscale liquid-vapor interface structure was demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Compressible mixing layer instabilities are of importance to a wide range of environmental and industrial applications. Past studies have focused on either ideal-gas or real-fluid thermodynamic regimes of single-species mixing layers. However, mixing layers of binary mixtures at supercritical conditions, commonly encountered in fuel injection systems, introduce additional complexities due to the added compositional degree-of-freedom. Moreover, the effect of strong variations in thermodynamic response functions across the Widom line on the binary mixing layer stability remains poorly understood. Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the coupling between the hydrodynamic instability and the real-fluid thermodynamics across the Widom line and its effects on the overall binary mixing layer dynamics. To this end, we develop a linear stability analysis of the full binary-species compressible transport equations coupled with the PC-SAFT equation of state. Analysis shows the existence of a novel instability mechanism that arises from juxtapositioning of the Widom-line transition and the hydrodynamic inflection point. This novel thermodynamically induced instability mechanism has the net effect of destabilizing the binary mixing layer at lowering supercritical conditions towards the critical pressure point. This is in contrast to previous stability analyses of supercritical single-species mixing layers, where increasing pressure destabilizes the flow due to its effect on reducing the density stratification. The discovered thermodynamically induced instability mechanism of binary mixing flows highlights the need for an extension of classical instability criteria to incorporate the effect of strong variations in the thermodynamic response functions across the Widom line on mixing layer instability.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to examine the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the transition between subcritical evaporation and supercritical dense-fluid-mixing in the absence of convection effects, specifically focusing on the liquid–vapor interfacial dynamics. To isolate the dynamics of this transition process, we characterize the different physical behaviors exhibited by an 𝑛-dodecane nanoscale droplet placed in different nitrogen ambient conditions across the fuel’s critical point. We employ a continuum-based interface-resolving diffuse-interface method to explore the underlying phase-exchange mechanisms that bring about such distinct dynamics. Following the comparison against molecular dynamics simulations and experiments of evaporating droplets and experimental data for vapor–liquid equilibria, a parametric study at various ambient conditions and droplet sizing is performed to identify four regimes of evaporation/mixing behaviors: sub- and supercritical droplet evaporation, and sub- and supercritical dense-fluid-mixing. It is shown that the distinction in the phaseexchange mechanisms in these four regimes are brought about by the different thermodynamic phases the droplet center can exhibit during the evaporation/mixing process: subcritical liquid, supercritical liquid-like, subcritical gaseous, and supercritical gas-like, respectively. It is shown that the subcritical dense-fluid-mixing behavior is a direct result of nanoconfinement of the liquid–vapor interfacial structure and thus is not present for large droplet sizes. The present study also shows that the supercritical phase-exchange dynamics can follow two different pathways: supercritical droplet-like evaporation and supercritical dense-fluid-mixing. Furthermore, promoting the early transition to supercritical dense-fluid-mixing can significantly expedite the phase-exchange process through the disintegration of the liquid-like droplet core.},

	abstract = {Heat transfer affects the performance and phasing of internal combustion engines. Correlations and equilibrium wallfunction models are typically employed in engine simulations to predict heat transfer. However, many studies have shown that significant errors are expected, owing to the failure of fundamental assumptions in deriving equilibrium wall-function models. Non-equilibrium wall models provide a more accurate way of describing the near-wall region of in-cylinder flows. In this study, simultaneous high-speed high-resolution particle image velocimetry and heat-flux measurements are conducted in an optically accessible engine. The experiments are performed under both motored and fired conditions at two different engine speeds. The experimental data are utilized to assess the performance of different models in predicting the thermoviscous boundary layer. These models include commonly used heat transfer correlations, equilibrium and modified wall-function models, and a recently developed non-equilibrium wall model. It is found that the equilibrium wall-function model significantly underpredicts the heat flux under both motored and fired conditions. By considering heat release effects in the boundary layer, the non-equilibrium wall model is shown to be able to adequately capture the structure and dynamics of both momentum and thermal boundary layers in comparison with experimental measurements, demonstrating its improved performance over previously employed correlation functions and the equilibrium model.},

A double-flux model is developed for transcritical flows to eliminate the spurious pressure oscillations. A hybrid scheme with entropy-stable flux correction is formulated to robustly represent large density ratios. The thermodynamics for ideal-gas values is modeled by a linearized specific heat ratio model. Parameters needed for the cubic EoS are pre-tabulated for the evaluation of departure functions and a quadratic expression is used to recover the attraction parameter. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the ability to account for pressure and temperature variations from the baseline table. Cryogenic LOX/GH2 mixing and reacting cases are performed to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in multidimensional simulations. The proposed combustion model and numerical schemes are directly applicable for LES simulations of real applications under transcritical conditions.},

	abstract = {Turbulent ﬂows under transcritical conditions are present in regenerative cooling systems of rocker engines and extraction processes in chemical engineering. The turbulent ﬂows and the corresponding heat transfer phenomena in these complex processes are still not well understood experimentally and numerically. The objective of this work is to investigate the turbulent ﬂows under transcritical conditions using DNS of turbulent channel ﬂows. A fully compressible solver is used in conjunction with a Peng-Robinson real-ﬂuid equation of state to describe the transcritical ﬂows. A channel ﬂow with two isothermal walls is simulated with one heated and one cooled boundary layers. The grid resolution adopted in this study is slightly ﬁner than that required for DNS of incompressible channel ﬂows. The simulations are conducted using both fully (FC) and quasi-conservative (QC) schemes to assess their performance for transcritical wall-bounded ﬂows. The instantaneous ﬂows and the statistics are analyzed and compared with the canonical theories. It is found that results from both FC and QC schemes qualitatively agree well with noticeable diﬀerence near the top heated wall, where spurious oscillations in velocity can be observed. Using the DNS data, we then examine the usefulness of Townsend attached eddy hypothesis in the context of ﬂows at transcritical conditions. It is shown that the streamwise energy spectrum exhibits the inverse wavenumber scaling and that the streamwise velocity structure function follows a logarithmic scaling, thus providing support to the attached eddy model at transcritical conditions.},

Associated with these conditions are strong variations in thermo-transport properties as the fluid undergoes mixing and phase transition, and two-stage ignition with low-temperature combustion. Accurately simulating these physical phenomena at real-fluid environments remains a challenge. This study examines a diffuse-interface method for simulating the injection and ignition of n-dodecane at transcritical conditions. To this end, a compressible solver with a real-fluid state equation and finite-rate chemistry is employed. Simulations of an ECN-relevant diesel-fuel injector are performed for both inert and reacting conditions. For the spray ignition, four specific operating points (corresponding to ambient temperatures between 900 K and 1200 K) are investigated to examine effects of the real-fluid environment and low-temperature chemistry. Comparisons with available experimental data demonstrate that the presented numerical method adequately captures the diesel fuel injection and auto-ignition processes under transcritical conditions.},

	abstract = {In the present work, the flame structure and dynamics of a swirl-stabilized methane/air flame near and at blow-out conditions are investigated using large-eddy simulations (LES). To this end, simulations at stable conditions and during a transient blow-out sequence are performed employing a flamelet/progress variable (FPV) model and a thickened flame (TFLES) approach with finite-rate chemistry. Good agreement is obtained for velocities, OH mass fraction profiles, and statistics between LES and measurements at conditions near blow-out. Lift-off height comparisons reveal that the TFLES model predicts a significantly less stable flame compared with the FPV model, which is consistent with the stability limits observed for the two models. Subsequently, transient blow-out simulations are performed and examined. This analysis is guided by employing early warning indicators from dynamical system analysis to identify critical transition points and precursors that trigger the onset of blow-out. It is found that the variance of the integrated heat release is a sensible quantity as an early warning signal in detecting blow-out. Detailed comparisons are then performed between the two models to examine the difference in terms of the blow-out mechanism. The comparison reveals that the different phases of the transient blow-out sequence are qualitatively similar for the two models. However, local extinction phenomena are more significant for the TFLES model, reducing the stabilizing feedback by hot combustion products and leading to a total blow-off time, which is three times shorter compared to FPV.},

The resulting sets of nonlinear equations for hydrodynamics and acoustics are two-way coupled. The coupling strength depends on which multiple scales are used. The double-time-double-space (2T-2S), double-time-single-space (2T-1S) and single-time-double-space (1T-2S) limits are revisited, derived and linearized. It is shown that only the 1T2S limit produces a two-way coupled linearized system. Therefore this limit is adopted and implemented in a finite-element solver. The methodology is applied to a coaxial jet combustor. By using an adjoint method and introducing the intrinsic sensitivity, (i) the interaction between the acoustic and hydrodynamic subsystems is calculated and (ii) the role of the global acceleration term, which is the coupling term from the acoustics to the hydrodynamics, is analyzed. For the confined coaxial jet diffusion flame studied here, (i) the growth rate of the thermo-acoustic oscillations is found to be more sensitive to small changes in the hydrodynamic field around the flame and (ii) increasing the global acceleration term is found to be stabilizing in agreement with the Rayleigh Criterion.},

	abstract = {By modeling a multi-component gas, a new source of indirect combustion noise is identiﬁed, which is named compositional indirect noise. The advection of mixture inhomogeneities exiting the gas-turbine combustion chamber through subsonic and supersonic nozzles is shown to be an acoustic dipole source of sound. The level of mixture inhomogeneity is described by a difference in composition with the mixture fraction. An n-dodecane mixture, which is a kerosene fuel relevant to aeronautics, is used to evaluate the level of compositional noise. By relaxing the compact-nozzle assumption, the indirect noise is numerically calculated for Helmholtz numbers up to 2 in nozzles with linear velocity proﬁle. The compact-nozzle limit is discussed. Only in this limit, it is possible to derive analytical transfer functions for (i) the noise emitted by the nozzle and (ii) the acoustics travelling back to the combustion chamber generated by accelerated compositional inhomogeneities. The former contributes to noise pollution, whereas the latter has the potential to induce thermoacoustic oscillations. It is shown that the compositional indirect noise can be at least as large as the direct noise and entropy noise in chocked nozzles and lean mixtures. As the frequency with which the compositional inhomogeneities enter the nozzle increases, or as the nozzle spatial length increases, the level of compositional noise decreases, with a similar, but not equal, trend to the entropy noise. The noisiest conﬁguration is found to be a compact supersonic nozzle.},

	abstract = {We have developed a new method for extracting particulates and gas-phase species from flames. This technique involves directing a small jet of inert gas through the flame to entrain the sample, which is then collected by a probe on the other side of the flame. This sampling technique does not require inserting a probe or sampling surface into the flame and thus avoids effects on the flame due to conductive cooling by the probe and recombination, quenching, and deposition reactions at the sampling surface in contact with the flame. This approach thus allows for quenching and diluting the sample during extraction while minimizing the perturbations to the flame that have a substantial impact on flame chemistry. It also circumvents clogging of the probe with soot, a problem that commonly occurs when a probe is inserted into a hydrocarbon-rich premixed or diffusion flame. In this paper, we present experimental results demonstrating the application of this technique to the extraction of soot particles from a co-flow ethylene/air diffusion flame. The extracted samples were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the results are compared with measurements using in situ diagnostics, i.e., laser-induced incandescence and small-angle X-ray scattering. We also compare TEM images of particles sampled using this approach with those sampled using rapidinsertion thermophoretic sampling, a common technique for extracting particles from flames. In addition, we have performed detailed numerical simulations of the flow field associated with this new sampling approach to assess the impact it has on the flame structure and sample following extraction. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that this jet-entrainment sampling technique has significant advantages over other common sample-extraction methods.},

The focus of this study is to examine effects of low-temperature chemistry (LTC) and spray evaporation in turbulent spray combustion. To this end, a first simulation is performed using a finite rate chemistry model with a 55-species skeletal mechanism including LTC in a fully compressible Eulerian-Lagrangian formulation. A second simulation is performed using the same formulation, but with the LTC chemical sub-mechanism deactivated. The interactions of spray and gasphase mixing and combustion are investigated through the consideration of mean and instantaneous LES results. Chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA) is extended to account for droplet evaporation in the context of spray combustion, the results of which reveal that the flame is dominated by non-premixed combustion without significant auto-ignitive behavior. CEMA results further show that the effect of spray evaporation on the reaction is two-fold, namely to inhibit reaction near the injector through heat absorption, and to facilitate reaction further downstream by supplying fuel to the gas phase. Mixture fraction-conditioned analysis is then performed to evaluate the importance of LTC in the turbulent spray flame, showing its effect on heat release despite the flame not exhibiting auto-ignitive behavior. A polar mapping is proposed for analyzing the complex interplay of low and high temperature chemistry heat release. The results have consequences for numerical modeling of spray combustion systems where LTC effects are commonly neglected.},

However, as emission requirements become increasingly stringent, engine manufacturers have sought to design combustion systems that operate near the fuel-lean limit of ﬂammability. In this study, superadiabatic matrixstabilized combustion, also known as porous media combustion, is evaluated as an advanced combustion concept for extending the lean ﬂammability limit to achieve improved efﬁciency and emissions. To this end, a Brayton cycle analysis is developed and key parameters of the porous matrix are identiﬁed for maximizing the extension of the lean ﬂammability limit. It is shown that stabilization of combustion below the nominal lean ﬂammability limit allows for the design of engines with signiﬁcantly higher pressure ratios and lower dilution ratios without increasing turbine inlet temperatures, thus improving cycle thermal efﬁciency. Combustor ﬂammability limits were shown to be extendable by up to 32\% when employing matrix-stabilized combustion, resulting in thermal efﬁciency gains of up to 11\% compared to a nominal design.},

	abstract = {Wall-stagnating spray flames are of importance in a number of engineering applications, including accidental leakage of liquid fuel from pressurized fuel lines as well as in direct-injected compression and spark-ignition engines. The wall heat flux generated by such flames is an important consideration in the design and analysis of affected components. To identify and analyze the key parametric dependencies of the flame structure and wall heat flux, we carry out one-dimensional simulations of wall-stagnating spray flames employing an Eulerian-Eulerian formulation and a realistic 54-species chemical mechanism for n-dodecane/air combustion. Conjugate heat transfer is accounted for by considering a finite-thickness wall. We find that the configuration permits three distinct flame structures, namely wall-stabilized, detached, and injector-stabilized flames. Since the near-wall flame structure determines the wall heat flux, the parameter space is explored to identify points of flame structure transition. We show that the Stokes number and the liquid mass loading play a key role in controlling the transition in the flame structure and its non-linear coupling to the wall heat flux, the former parameter by controlling the droplet evaporation time and the latter by affecting the amount of fuel able to penetrate the flame. The wall boundary temperature has a direct effect on the wall heat flux, and we show that it exhibits hysteresis in flame structure transition, with an associated change in wall heat flux of up to 30 percent.},

In this work, we combine X-ray Raman spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to characterize the local electronic structure of supercritical CO2 at conditions around the critical point. The X-ray Raman oxygen K-edge spectra manifest systematic trends associated with the phase change of CO2 and the intermolecular distance. Extensive first-principles DFT calculations rationalize these observations on the basis of the 4sσ Rydberg state hybridization. X-ray Raman spectroscopy is found to be a sensitive tool for characterizing electronic properties of CO2 under challenging experimental conditions and is demonstrated to be a unique probe for studying the electronic structure of supercritical fluids.},

	abstract = {Indirect combustion noise is a growing concern for aviation engine designers. It is typically associated with the distortion of “hot spots” (entropy structures) and vortical structures that generate excess noise as they are convected by an accelerating mean flow. Recently, it has been shown theoretically that fluctuations in a gas’s chemical composition can act as an additional source of indirect noise in aviation engines. This work examines this composition noise mechanism, focusing on the underlying chemical effects that drive this source of indirect noise. Since the mechanism has yet to be confirmed experimentally, this paper begins by applying the theory to inert mixtures of noble gases and air, in an attempt to guide experimentalists by identifying the set of operating conditions that will produce the strongest acoustic response. Turning from non-reacting to reacting flows, the paper next examines the sensitivity of the compositional noise mechanism to fuel type, testing several common fuels. It is found that, while there is a substantial difference between hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels, overall noise levels vary only slightly between different hydrocarbon fuels. Additionally, there appears to be a common underlying structure to the response of a product-gas mixture generated by burning a fuel, which is explained through linearized theory and confirmed with numerical results. Lastly, the physics of composition noise is examined at the species-specific level, attempting to provide a link between individual combustion products and changes in a mixture’s propensity to generate indirect noise. The sensitivity of individual species can be explained by a combination of differences between the species and mixture’s Gibbs free energy and strong gradients in product gas concentration with mixture fraction. However, by analyzing the species dependency of combustion products at several different mean mixture fractions, it is found that no single species dominates the noise generation over the combustor’s entire range, but rather the most acoustically active species varies strongly with local stoichiometry.},

In order to investigate these phenomena, direct numerical simulations of a turbulent premixed flame are analyzed in this study. The results reveal a flux of kinetic energy that involves a cross-scale transfer through the turbulence cascade and whose prevailing direction in the flame brush is from subgrid to resolved scales. The root cause of this reversal in energy transfer, termed subgrid-scale (SGS) backscatter, is the effect of thermal expansion in the subgrid scales, by which small amounts of enthalpy created by combustion heat release are transformed into small-scale kinetic energy by means of the SGS pressure-gradient velocity correlation. The resulting overload of SGS kinetic energy is transferred to the resolved scales through SGS backscatter. This cross-scale flux of energy, along with a larger one that relies on large-scale quantities only and does not involve the energy cascade, describes the transformation of combustion heat release into kinetic energy in the turbulent premixed flame. Based on scaling analyses, it is theorized that the contribution of the cross-scale flux to the total kinetic-energy augmentation vanishes in combustion regimes in which the flame-transit time is too short to allow for activation of the non-linear convective mechanisms of the energy cascade.},

              This study addresses the dynamics of backscatter of kinetic energy in the context of large-eddy simulations (LES) of high-speed turbulent reacting flows.
              A priori
              analyses of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of reacting and inert supersonic, time-developing, hydrogen–air turbulent mixing layers with complex chemistry and multicomponent diffusion are conducted here in order to examine the effects of compressibility and combustion on subgrid-scale (SGS) backscatter of kinetic energy. The main characteristics of the aerothermochemical field in the mixing layer are outlined. A selfsimilar period is identified in which some of the turbulent quantities grow in a quasi-linear manner. A differential filter is applied to the DNS flow field to extract filtered quantities of relevance for the large-scale kinetic-energy budget. Spatiotemporal analyses of the flow-field statistics in the selfsimilar regime are performed, which reveal the presence of considerable amounts of SGS backscatter. The dilatation field becomes spatially intermittent as a result of the high-speed compressibility effect. In addition, the large-scale pressure-dilatation work is observed to be an essential mechanism for the local conversion of thermal and kinetic energies. A joint probability density function (PDF) of SGS dissipation and large-scale pressure-dilatation work is provided, which shows that backscatter occurs primarily in regions undergoing volumetric expansion; this implies the existence of an underlying physical mechanism that enhances the reverse energy cascade. Furthermore, effects of SGS backscatter on the Boussinesq eddy viscosity are studied, and a regime diagram demonstrating the relationship between the different energy-conversion modes and the sign of the eddy viscosity is provided along with a detailed budget of the volume fraction in each mode. A joint PDF of SGS dissipation and SGS dynamic-pressure dilatation work is calculated, which shows that high-speed compressibility effects lead to a decorrelation between SGS backscatter and negative eddy viscosities, which increases for increasingly large values of the SGS Mach number and filter width. Finally, it is found that the combustion dynamics have a marginal impact on the backscatter and flow-dilatation distributions, which are mainly dominated by the high-Mach-number effects.},

              A major barrier toward the practical application of lithium-oxygen batteries is the high overpotential caused by the precipitation of oxygen-reduction products at the cathode, resulting in poor cyclability. By combining first-principle calculations and reactive molecular dynamics simulations, we show that surface functionalization of 2D MXene nanosheets offers a high degree of tunability of the catalytic activity for oxygen-reduction and oxygen-evolution reactions (ORR/OER). We show that the controlled creation of active vacancy sites on the MXene surface enhances ORR in excess of a factor of 60 compared to graphene-based cathode materials. Furthermore, we find that increasing the ratio of fluorine vs. oxygen termination of the functionalized Ti

A non-adiabatic flamelet model is utilized with the purpose of examining its capability to predict the wall heat transfer. Good agreement of the simulation results with measurements of heat flux and pressure profiles is obtained using the non-adiabatic model. By comparing results with a frozen flamelet model, the importance of the recombination reactions in the cold boundary layer is investigated. The species profiles of CO and CO2 are examined and the reaction pathways leading to the recombination reactions at the wall were analyzed. Results from this analysis show that the reaction of OH with CO forming CO2 is the main contributor to the additional heat release in the boundary layer.},

            Recent experiments on pure fluids have identified distinct liquid-like and gas-like regimes even under supercritical conditions. The supercritical liquid-gas transition is marked by maxima in response functions that define a line emanating from the critical point, referred to as Widom line. However, the structure of analogous state transitions in mixtures of supercritical fluids has not been determined, and it is not clear whether a Widom line can be identified for binary mixtures. Here, we present first evidence for the existence of multiple Widom lines in binary mixtures from molecular dynamics simulations. By considering mixtures of noble gases, we show that, depending on the phase behavior, mixtures transition from a liquid-like to a gas-like regime via distinctly different pathways, leading to phase relationships of surprising complexity and variety. Specifically, we show that miscible binary mixtures have behavior analogous to a pure fluid and the supercritical state space is characterized by a single liquid-gas transition. In contrast, immiscible binary mixture undergo a phase separation in which the clusters transition separately at different temperatures, resulting in multiple distinct Widom lines. The presence of this unique transition behavior emphasizes the complexity of the supercritical state to be expected in high-order mixtures of practical relevance.},

              Recent theoretical and experimental studies reported ultra-high water permeability and salt rejection in nanoporous single-layer graphene. However, creating and controlling the size and distribution of nanometer-scale pores pose significant challenges to application of these membranes for water desalination. Graphyne and hydrogenated graphyne have tremendous potential as ultra-permeable membranes for desalination and wastewater reclamation due to their uniform pore-distribution, atomic thickness and mechano-chemical stability. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and upscale continuum analysis, the desalination performance of bare and hydrogenated α-graphyne and γ-\{2,3,4\}-graphyne membranes is evaluated as a function of pore size, pore geometry, chemical functionalization and applied pressure. MD simulations show that pores ranging from 20 to 50 Å

Pore chemistry, functionalization and geometry are shown to play a critical role in modulating the water flux, and these observations are explained by water velocity, density, and energy barriers in the pores. The atomistic scale investigations are complemented by upscale continuum analysis to examine the performance of these membranes in application to cross-flow RO systems. This upscale analysis, however, shows that the significant increase in permeability, observed from MD simulations, does not fully translate to current RO systems due to transport limitations. Nevertheless, upscale calculations predict that the higher permeability of graphyne membranes would allow up to six times higher permeate recovery or up to 6\% less energy consumption as compared to thin-film composite membranes at currently accessible operating conditions. Significantly higher energy savings and permeate recovery can be achieved if higher feed-flow rates can be realized.},

            New phase diagrams for water confined in graphene nanocapillaries and single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are proposed, identifying ice structures, their melting points and revealing the presence of a solid-liquid critical point. For quasi-2D water in nanocapillaries, we show through molecular-dynamics simulations that AA stacking in multilayer quasi-2D ice arises from interlayer hydrogen-bonding and is stable up to three layers, thereby explaining recent experimental observations. Detailed structural and energetic analyses show that quasi-2D water can freeze discontinuously through a first-order phase transition or continuously with a critical point. The first-order transition line extends to a continuous transition line, defined by a sharp transition in diffusivity between solid-like and liquid-like regimes. For quasi-1D water, confined in CNTs, we observe the existence of a similar critical point at intermediate densities. In addition, an end point is identified on the continuous-transition line, above which the solid and liquid phases deform continuously. The solid-liquid phase transition temperatures in CNTs are shown to be substantially higher than 273 K, confirming recent Raman spectroscopy measurements. We observe ultrafast proton and hydroxyl transport in quasi-1D and -2D ice at 300 K, exceeding those of bulk water up to a factor of five, thereby providing possible applications to fuel-cells and electrolyzers.},

In this work, the effects of radiation and buoyancy in a turbulent nonpremixed ﬂame and plume are studied by quantitatively comparing measured and computed images of the mid-infrared radiation intensity. To this end, a turbulent nonpremixed jet ﬂame (Reynolds number 15,200 and CH4/H2/N2 fuel composition) is considered, representing a benchmark ﬂame conﬁguration of the International Workshop on Measurement and Computation of Turbulent Nonpremixed Flames (TNF Workshop). Quantitative images of the radiation intensity from the ﬂame are acquired using a calibrated high-speed mid-infrared camera and band-pass ﬁlters. The camera and ﬁlters enable time-dependent measurements of radiation from water vapor and carbon dioxide over the entire ﬂame length and beyond. Results of the solution to the radiative transfer equation are rendered in the form of images using scalar values from large eddy simulations (LES) and a narrowband radiation model. Planar images obtained from experiments and simulations for the radiation intensity display qualitatively comparable features, including localized regions of high and low intensity that are characteristic of turbulent ﬂames. The quantitative comparison of the measured and computed temperature proﬁles and radiation intensities, particularly in the plume region downstream of the stoichiometric ﬂame length, indicate that including radiation heat loss is important even for weakly radiating ﬂames. The results demonstrate that quantitative experimental and model-based imaging of mid-infrared radiation intensity is useful for assessing the results of narrowband radiation and combustion models.},

            Droplets provide unique opportunities for the investigation of laser-induced surface chemistry. Chemical reactions on the surface of charged droplets are ubiquitous in nature and can provide critical insight into more efficient processes for industrial chemical production. Here, we demonstrate the application of the reaction nanoscopy technique to strong-field ionized nanodroplets of propanediol (PDO). The technique’s sensitivity to the near-field around the droplet allows for the in-situ characterization of the average droplet size and charge. The use of ultrashort laser pulses enables control of the amount of surface charge by the laser intensity. Moreover, we demonstrate the surface chemical sensitivity of reaction nanoscopy by comparing droplets of the isomers 1,2-PDO and 1,3-PDO in their ion emission and fragmentation channels. Referencing the ion yields to gas-phase data, we find an enhanced production of methyl cations from droplets of the 1,2-PDO isomer. Density functional theory simulations support that this enhancement is due to the alignment of 1,2-PDO molecules on the surface. The results pave the way towards spatio-temporal observations of charge dynamics and surface reactions on droplets.},

The analysis yields characteristic ratios dependent on the local curvature of the mixture fraction ﬁeld, the scalar dissipation rate, and the ﬂame thickness, which indicate whether tangential diffusion effects become important. By comparing relevant scales, a regime diagram is developed and three different ﬂamelet regimes are identiﬁed. In regime I, the classical ﬂamelet equations are valid. In regime II, differential diffusion of species and temperature in ﬂame-tangential direction becomes relevant. In regime III, additional transport along mixture fraction isosurfaces exhibits an inﬂuence on the ﬂame structure. In the latter case it is not sufﬁcient to condition species mass fractions and temperature on the mixture fraction alone since these quantities are not represented by a one-dimensional structure.},

              Local linear stability analysis has been shown to provide valuable information about the response of jet diffusion flames to flow-field perturbations. However, this analysis commonly relies on several modelling assumptions about the mean flow prescription, the thermo-viscous-diffusive transport properties, and the complexity and representation of the chemical reaction mechanisms. In this work, the effects of these modelling assumptions on the stability behaviour of a jet diffusion flame are systematically investigated. A flamelet formulation is combined with linear stability theory to fully account for the effects of complex transport properties and the detailed reaction chemistry on the perturbation dynamics. The model is applied to a methane–air jet diffusion flame that was experimentally investigated by Füri
              et al.
              (
              Proc. Combust. Inst.
              , vol. 29, 2002, pp. 1653–1661). Detailed simulations are performed to obtain mean flow quantities, about which the stability analysis is performed. Simulation results show that the growth rate of the inviscid instability mode is insensitive to the representation of the transport properties at low frequencies, and exhibits a stronger dependence on the mean flow representation. The effects of the complexity of the reaction chemistry on the stability behaviour are investigated in the context of an adiabatic jet flame configuration. Comparisons with a detailed chemical-kinetics model show that the use of a one-step chemistry representation in combination with a simplified viscous-diffusive transport model can affect the mean flow representation and heat release location, thereby modifying the instability behaviour. This is attributed to the shift in the flame structure predicted by the one-step chemistry model, and is further exacerbated by the representation of the transport properties. A pinch-point analysis is performed to investigate the stability behaviour; it is shown that the shear-layer instability is convectively unstable, while the outer buoyancy-driven instability mode transitions from absolutely to convectively unstable in the nozzle near field, and this transition point is dependent on the Froude number.},

While temperature fluctuations are commonly recognized as the primary source of indirect combustion noise, recent theoretical analysis has shown that mixture inhomogeneities and associated variations in the Gibbs free energy represent another indirect noise-source contribution that is further investigated in this study. To this end, a hybrid model is developed that combines large-eddy simulations for predicting the unsteady turbulent reacting flow field in the combustor with a linearized Euler solver to describe the transmission and generation of noise through the downstream nozzle. By considering an operating point near the lean blow-out limit at cruise conditions, it is shown that indirect noise has an appreciable contribution to the overall noise emission at low frequencies, and direct noise arising from a tonal instability in the combustor dominates at higher frequencies. At this operating point, indirect noise contributing from compositional inhomogeneities was found to be comparable in magnitude to entropy noise from temperature inhomogeneities. A modal analysis of the indirect noise sources showed that the entropy and compositional noise are shifted in phase, resulting in a cancellation of the indirect noise. Effects of Mach number and modal shape of the combustor-exit perturbations on the noise generation are investigated, demonstrating the importance of spatial inhomogeneities to the core-noise contribution.},

The effect of operating conditions on the relative noise-source contributions arising from direct and indirect noise is examined by considering take-off and cruise conditions. To quantify the predictions of the combustion flow field, comparisons with available experimental data for velocity and spray droplet diameter are performed. Analysis of combustion dynamics shows that tonal combustion noise from a thermoacoustic instability is present at both operating conditions, which is consistent with experimental data. The unsteady combustion and dilution are the main sources for the fluctuations of pressure, temperature and mixture composition at the combustor exit. While the thermo-chemical properties do not significantly change between the two operating conditions, the simulation results show that the level of unsteadiness in the flow field is significantly higher for the take-off condition. This leads to an overall increase in the noise emissions by up to 20 dB at takeoff compared to the cruise condition. Indirect noise arising from compositional inhomogeneities is found to exceed the entropy noise for both operating conditions. Phase cancellation between composition noise and temperature-induced noise is shown to result in an overall reduction of the indirect combustion-noise emissions.},

This mathematical reconstruction agrees very well with molecular simulations data. Our results show that the ﬂuid molecular electrostatic moments are positively correlated with the number of adsorption layers in the pore. Moreover, stronger electrostatic moments lead to adsorption at lower pressures. These ﬁndings can be applied to improve pore-scale thermodynamic and transport models.},

In this work, we employ reactive molecular dynamics simulations to study how the CO2 fluid environment affects the mechanical properties of pre-cracked single-crystal quartz. The thermodynamic conditions of interest are those relevant to subsurface reservoirs. We report how structural properties of quartz—bond length distribution and crack tip shape—evolve upon introduction of a fluid. These properties are directly related to macroscopic quantities of the global stress–strain curves, thus reaffirming the inherent coupling across multiple scales for fluid–solid interactions in the subsurface. We find that CO2 reduces the fracture toughness of quartz by 12.1\% compared to that of quartz in vacuum, thereby promoting crack growth and enhancing fluid transport in the subsurface.},

            Supercritical fluids play a key role in environmental, geological, and celestial processes, and are of great importance to many scientific and engineering applications. They exhibit strong variations in thermodynamic response functions, which has been hypothesized to stem from the microstructural behavior. However, a direct connection between thermodynamic conditions and the microstructural behavior, as described by molecular clusters, remains an outstanding issue. By utilizing a first-principles-based criterion and self-similarity analysis, we identify energetically localized molecular clusters whose size distribution and connectivity exhibit self-similarity in the extended supercritical phase space. We show that the structural response of these clusters follows a complex network behavior whose dynamics arises from the energetics of isotropic molecular interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a hidden variable network model can accurately describe the structural and dynamical response of supercritical fluids. These results highlight the need for constitutive models and provide a basis to relate the fluid microstructure to thermodynamic response functions.},

	abstract = {Nanoconfined fluids exhibit remarkably different thermodynamic behavior compared to the bulk phase. These confinement effects render predictions of thermodynamic quantities of nanoconfined fluids challenging. In particular, confinement creates a spatially varying density profile near the wall that is primarily responsible for adsorption and capillary condensation behavior. Significant fluctuations in thermodynamic quantities, inherent in such nanoscale systems, coupled to strong fluid−wall interactions give rise to this near-wall density profile. Empirical models have been proposed to explain and model these effects, yet no first-principles based formulation has been developed. We present a statistical mechanics framework that embeds such a coupling to describe the effect of the fluid− wall interaction in amplifying the near-wall density behavior for compressible gases at elevated pressures such as pressurized methane in confinement. We show that the proposed theory predicts accurately the adsorbed layer thickness as obtained with small-angle neutron scattering measurements. Furthermore, the predictions of density under confinement from the proposed theory are shown to be in excellent agreement with available experimental and atomistic simulations data for a range of temperatures for nanoconfined methane. While the framework is presented for evaluating the near-wall density, owing to its rigorous foundation in statistical mechanics, the proposed theory can also be generalized for predicting phase-transition and nonequilibrium transport of nanoconfined fluids.},

In this work, a PMB design having a spatially graded porous matrix is proposed, supported by theoretical analysis of the governing equations and constitutive relations. Through computations and experiments, it is shown that the proposed physical design of the porous matrix results in a significant enhancement of the power-dynamic range and in excess of 50\% higher blow-off limits compared to current designs. This is achieved through gradation in topology (i.e. porosity, pore diameter, cell diameter, etc.), which enables a continuous variation of radiative extinction properties as well as interphase heat exchange, allowing the flame to stabilize dynamically within the porous matrix and for a wider range of operating conditions.},

After evaluating the accuracy of individual model components against available experimental data, the model is applied to investigate the ignition of a surrogate mixture for a Jet-A fuel (POSF 4658) at conditions of interest to gas turbine engines. A parametric study is performed to examine effects on the interaction between multicomponent evaporation and ignition. It is found that the maximum reactivity occurs for conditions at which the ignition time in the gas phase is comparable to the evaporation time. At these conditions, the mixture composition is significantly affected by preferential evaporation, which in turn affects the reactivity of the gas phase. It is shown that intradroplet diffusion plays a major role on the radial droplet composition, thereby conditioning the evaporation rates of single species. A comparison with a zero-diffusivity model for the treatment of droplet internal diffusion emphasizes the importance of liquid diffusion on the autoignition time, and confirms the need for properly accounting for a detailed description of multicomponent evaporation effects.},

In the present work, mesoscale-resolved simulations of a 3D turbulent counterﬂow spray conﬁguration are conducted. Primary focus is on examining the eﬀect of the coupling between turbulence, evaporation, mixing, and combustion. By considering diﬀerent initial droplet diameters and through comparisons with turbulent and laminar conﬁgurations at the same operating condition, it is shown that preferential concentration can lead to conditions of locally high mixture-fraction composition. In addition, local variability in strain rate and droplet diameter introduces a bifurcation of the spray ﬂame. This bifurcation consists of spray ﬂame structures exhibiting single-reaction or doublereaction structures. It is shown that this bimodal behavior is linked to the existence of a hysteresis in the laminar spray ﬂame structure for droplet diameter variations, as well as the occurrence of a bifurcation for strain rate variations. These results have direct implications for ﬂamelet-based tabulation methods, since identifying the appropriate ﬂamelet structure in turbulent spray ﬂames would require informations about boundary conditions and the ﬂamelet history.},

	title = {Enabling ultra-lean combustion of ammonia-hydrogen in porous media burners},
	abstract = {To mitigate climate change caused by the anthropogenic release of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere, many industries must transition to carbon-free renewable energy sources within the next decades. One of the possible fuels considered for this task is ammonia. It is a carbon-free fuel that can be synthesized from green hydrogen and whose combustion does not emit any greenhouse gases [1–3]. Several challenges must however be addressed before this fuel can be widely deployed in practical systems: ammonia-air flames have a significantly slower flame speed, higher ignition temperature and larger flame thickness than conventional hydrocarbon flames. Ammonia combustion can also generate significant amounts of pollutants such as nitric oxides and unburnt ammonia. Porous media have been used to address similar combustion challenges and allow the stabilization of very lean flames for applications such as gas turbines, jet engines and radiant heaters for industrial processes [4–7]. In this work, we extend previous studies [8, 9] and examine the stabilization of ammonia-hydrogen-air flame in a porous media burner, with a particular focus on lean mixtures. Flames are stabilized at the interface between two open-cell ceramic foam with different pore size [10]. Heat is recirculated by conduction and radiation in the ceramic matrix, thereby preheating the fuel and enhancing the flame consumption rate. We demonstrate experimentally that an adequately designed porous media burner can stabilize flames over a wide range of operating conditions: (1) from pure ammonia to a 40\% hydrogen volume fraction; (2) very lean (φ = 0.5) to rich (φ = 1.4); and (3) with a turn-down ratio greater than 15:1. Power densities in excess of 90 MW m−3 can also be achieved. Finally we report the NOx and unburnt ammonia emissions of this porous media burner and find that operation in the ultra-lean regime can lead to a good compromise between low NOx and low unburnt ammonia emissions.},

	abstract = {Ammonia offers a carbon-free fuel alternative for industrial heating, power generation and transportation. However, its low flame speed and high NOx emission represent significant challenges for combustor applications. The present study investigates the use of porous media burners (PMBs) to stabilize lean NH3/H2/air flames. By stabilizing the flame at the interface between two thermally conductive ceramic foams, internal heat recirculation preheats the reactants and increases the flame speed, which increases the combustion stability limits to very lean NH3/H2/air mixtures. Experimental studies are conducted to determine the stability limits of porous media combustion over a wide range of NH3/H2 volume ratios, equivalence ratios and mass fluxes. The NH3/H2 ratio is found to play a significant role with a typical dependency of the equivalence ratio at extinction in the form φext ∝ XH−20.3. NOx emissions were shown to reach their minimum when the burner was operated near its extinction limit and to increase with increasing mass flux rates. Because unburnt NH3 emissions were also quite low (1400 ppm) at these very lean conditions, this operating regime offers similar or better emissions compared to the commonly employed fuel-rich operation which has been suggested in the literature.},

	abstract = {Spray combustion is of practical importance to various applications. To study spray flames, benchmark cases were investigated both experimentally and numerically. Previous numerical studies of these flames have identified sensitivities to gas-phase combustion models and the description of the droplet evaporation. The objective of this work is to examine effects of combustion models on the structure of an acetone spray flame. To this end, three different combustion models are examined, namely a finite-rate chemistry model, a flamelet/progress variable model, and a flame prolongation of intrinsic low dimensional manifold model. In the two flamelet approaches, effects of spray evaporation are considered in the limit of small Stokes number. By examining radial profiles and employing a doubly-conditioned analysis on gaseous mixture fraction and liquid-to-gas mass ratio, it is shown that both flamelet models show differences in the evaporation and subsequent gas phase combustion and temperature field. The use of a finite-rate combustion model in conjunction with a reduced chemical mechanism provide improved predictions of heat release and spray-flame structure. © 2018 The Combustion Institute.

	abstract = {Infrasound observations are increasingly used to constrain properties of volcanic eruptions. In order to better interpret infrasound observations, however, there is a need to better understand the relationship between eruption properties and sound generation. Here we perform two-dimensional computational aeroacoustic simulations where we solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations for pure-air with a large-eddy simulation approximation. We simulate idealized impulsive volcanic eruptions where the exit velocity is specified and the eruption is pressure-balanced with the atmosphere. Our nonlinear simulation results are compared with the commonly used analytical linear acoustics model of a compact monopole source radiating acoustic waves isotropically in a half space. The monopole source model matches the simulations for low exit velocities (100 m/s or M  0.3 where M is the Mach number); however, the two solutions diverge as the exit velocity increases with the simulations developing lower peak amplitude, more rapid onset, and anisotropic radiation with stronger infrasound signals recorded above the vent than on Earth's surface. Our simulations show that interpreting ground-based infrasound observations with the monopole source model can result in an underestimation of the erupted volume for eruptions with sonic or supersonic exit velocities. We examine nonlinear effects and show that nonlinear effects during propagation are relatively minor for the parameters considered. Instead, the dominant nonlinear effect is advection by the complex flow structure that develops above the vent. This work demonstrates the need to consider anisotropic radiation patterns and jet dynamics when interpreting infrasound observations, particularly for eruptions with sonic or supersonic exit velocities.},

The MD simulations allow for presenting the complete dynamic process of the TTIP conversion at the atomic level. The rate constant of TTIP hydrolysis at 1 atm is estimated to be k = 1.23 × 1014 × exp(−11, 323/T (K))mol−1cm3s−1 using a second-order reaction model. On the basis of Ti-containing intermediate species profiles, the evolutions of the main decomposition products during the TTIP hydrolysis are identified and key reaction pathways are elucidated. The results show that the clusters are formed before TiO2 molecules are observed. During the decomposition, Ti-containing species with one or two C–O bonds and carbon-free species with more than two Ti–O bonds are formed and undergo two separate pathways. One is the combination via the formation of Ti–O–Ti bridges, forming early clusters that serve as precursors for large TiO2 nanoparticles. The other is the further decomposition to smaller molecules such as TiO2 that participate in the subsequent cluster formation. Interactions between Ti and O atoms in the cluster stabilize the large structure through the abstraction of water and –CxHy groups.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to characterize effects of turbulence and ﬂow-ﬁeld inhomogeneities on the mixing and ignition-dynamics in ﬂow reactors. Speciﬁc focus is on investigating the ignition characteristics of hydrogen-containing fuels at gas-turbine-relevant operating conditions. Two different model formulations are developed to describe the mixing, induction, and subsequent ignition and combustion. Utilizing these models, parametric studies are performed in a generic ﬂow reactor conﬁguration that is representative of commonly employed facilities. Diagnostics is developed to quantify the ignition dynamics. Results show that in the case of an initially homogeneous mixture, the ignition process is fairly insensitive to the underlying ﬂow-ﬁeld. However, by considering inhomogeneities in temperature and mixture composition it is shown that the ignition process exhibits a more pronounced sensitivity to temperature perturbations, and the ignition delay is only weakly sensitive to initial equivalence ratio perturbations. Simulation results show that temperature ﬂuctuations of less than 10\% of the mean temperature are sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly affect the ignition-onset. Results from this parametric study identify the need for quantitative measurements of temperature and composition to better characterize ﬂow reactor facilities. A time-scale analysis is performed to characterize competing physical processes that are associated with turbulent mixing, autoignition, and ﬂame propagation. Qualitative comparisons with experimental data suggest the possibility for deﬂagrative ignition modes that can occur at low temperature operating conditions.},

	abstract = {The utilization of low-dimensional manifold combustion models for large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent reactive ﬂows introduces model simpliﬁcations that represent sources of uncertainties in addition to those arising from turbulent closure models and numerical discretization. The ability to quantitatively assess these uncertainties in the absence of measurements or reference results is vital for reliable and predictive simulations of practical combustion devices. This paper is concerned with the extension of the manifold drift term to LES to examine the compliance of a particular combustion model in describing a quantity of interest (QoI) with respect to the underlying ﬂow-ﬁeld representation. This drift term was previously introduced as a key component of the Pareto-efﬁcient combustion (PEC) framework. The behavior of the drift term is examined in a series of test cases. To this end, large-eddy simulations of a partially-premixed turbulent pilot ﬂame with inhomogeneous inlet streams are performed, in which the non-premixed ﬂamelet/progress-variable (FPV) model and the premixed ﬁltered tabulated chemistry LES (F-TACLES) formulation are employed. The drift term is shown to be capable of identifying chemically sensitive regions with respect to user-speciﬁc QoIs. With this, a species-speciﬁc combustion regime indicator is derived by computing the relative magnitude of the drift terms for different combustion models. Comparisons with commonly employed ﬂame indicators suggests that the ﬂame index and other indicators that are solely based on major species and ﬂame topology are insufﬁcient in describing complex physical processes in multi-regime combustion.},

	abstract = {The Volvo burner features the canonical conﬁguration of a bluﬀ-body stabilized premixed ﬂame. This conﬁguration was studied experimentally under the Volvo Flygmotor AB program. Two cases are considered in this study: a non-reacting case with an inlet ﬂow speed of 16.6 m/s and a reacting case with equilibrium ratio of 0.65 and inﬂow speed of 17.3 m/s. The characteristic vortex shedding in the wake behind the bluﬀ body is present in the non-reacting case, while two oscillation modes are intermittently present in the reacting case. A series of large-eddy simulations are performed on this conﬁguration using two solvers, one using a high-resolution ﬁnite-volume (FV) scheme and the other featuring a high-order discontinuousGalerkin (DG) discretization. The FV calculations are conducted on hexahedral meshes with three diﬀerent resolution (4mm, 2mm, and 1mm). The DG calculations are performed using two diﬀerent polynomial orders on the same tetrahedral mesh. For the non-reacting cases, good agreement with respect to the experimental data is achieved by both solvers at high numerical resolution. The reacting cases are calculated using a two-step global mechanism in combination with the thickened-ﬂame model. Reasonable agreement with experiments is obtained by both solvers at higher resolution. Models for combustion-turbulence interaction are necessary for the reacting case as it contains the length scale of the ﬂame, which is smaller than the grid resolution in all calculations. The impact of such models on the ﬂame stability and ﬂow/ﬂame dynamics is the subject of future research.},

	abstract = {In the application of the combustion models based on low-dimensional manifolds (for instance flamelet models) to large-eddy simulation (LES) of reactive turbulent flows, the modeling simplifications of the combustion process is a critical source of uncertainty in addition to those due to the turbulent closure model and numerical discretization. The ability to quantitatively assess this uncertainty in absence of the reference result is vital to the reliable and predictive simulations of practical combustion devices.In the present study, the Pareto-efficient combustion (PEC) framework is extended to adaptive LES combustion simulations of turbulent flames. The key component of the PEC framework is the so-called manifold drift term. Its extension LES is proposed to make such assessment by examining the compliance of a particular combustion model in describing a quantity of interest with respect to the underlying flow field representation. With the focus on improving predictions of CO emissions of flamelet-based combustion models, this work employs PEC to augment the flamelet/progress variable (FPV) model through local sub-model assignment of the finite-rate chemistry (FRC) model. To this end, a series of LES-PEC calculations are performed on a piloted partially-premixed dimethyl ether flame (DME-D), using a combination of FPV and FRC models. The drift term is utilized in the PEC framework to the estimate the model related error for quantities of interest. The PEC approach is demonstrated to be capable of significantly improving the prediction of CO emissions compared with the monolithic FPV simulation. The improved accuracy is achieved by enriching the FPV model with FRC in regions where the lower-order model is determined insufficient through the evaluation of drift terms.},

The operator splitting is based on the Simpler balanced splitting method, which is constructed with improved stability properties and reduced computational cost. The method is shown to be capable of stable and accurate prediction of ignition and extinction for reaction-diﬀusion systems near critical conditions. The ROK4E scheme is designed for semi-implicit integration of spatially independent chemically reacting systems. Being a Rosenbrock-Krylov method, ROK4E utilizes the low-rank approximation of the Jacobian to reduce the cost for integrating the system of ODEs that have relative few stiﬀ components. The eﬃciency of the scheme is further improved via the careful choice of coeﬃcients to require three right-hand-side evaluations over four stages. Combing these two methods, eﬃcient calculation is achieved for large-scale parallel simulations of turbulent ﬂames.},

	abstract = {In this work, methods for the evaluation of LES-quality and LES-accuracy are presented, which include the Lyapunov exponent for the analysis of short-time predictability of LES-calculation and the Wasserstein metric for the quantitative assessment of simulation results. Both methods are derived and evaluated in application to the Volvo test case. Both the non-reacting and reacting cases are calculated. For the non- reacting cases, good agreement with the experimental data is achieved by solvers at high numerical resolution. The reacting cases are more challenging due to the small length scale of the flame and the suppression of sinuous mode of absolute instability by the density ratio. The analysis of the turbulent simulation data using the concept of the Lyapunov exponent and the Wasserstein metric provides a more quantitative approach to assess the mesh dependency of the simulation results. The convergence of the Lyapunov exponent is shown to be a more sensitive and stronger indication of mesh-independence. Though grid convergence for the reacting cases cannot be reached with the chosen resolutions, the Lyapunov exponents and the Wasserstein metric are shown to be capable of identifying quantity-specific sensitivities with respect to the numerical resolution, while requiring significantly less computational resources than acquiring profiles of conventional turbulent statistics.},

The proposed approach combines steady-state preserving operator splitting, semi-implicit ODE integration, and dynamic load rebalancing. Specifically, the simpler balanced splitting method is constructed as a second-order steady-state preserving operator splitting formulation, with improved stability properties and reduced computational cost compared with the original simple balanced splitting method. The method is shown to be capable of accurately capturing ignition and extinction for reaction–diffusion systems near critical conditions. The semiimplicit integration scheme, namely ROK4E, is constructed following the order conditions of the Rosenbrock–Krylov methods with improved efficiency. Designed for the integration of homogeneous reacting systems, ROK4E utilizes the low-rank approximation of the Jacobian to reduce the cost for integrating the system of ODEs that has relatively few stiff components compared with the interval of the integration. To address the scalability issue associated with the spatial clustering of chemical reactivity, a dynamic load rebalancing procedure is developed. The resulting time-integration techniques are employed in a 3D simulation of a temporally evolving turbulent planar flame with dimethyl ether/air chemistry, and improvements with respect to the computational efficiency and strong scalability are examined.},

The focus of this study is to examine the effects of chemistry, in particular the low-temperature chemistry, on the structure of canonical counterflow spray flames at relatively low strain rate conditions. Parametric studies using a Eulerian formulation are carried out for monodisperse n-dodecane counterflow spray flames, in order to analyze the sensitivity of the flame structure to strain rate and droplet diameter over a wide range of equivalence ratios. These results reveal complex and multi-modal spray-flame structures that exhibit collocated, distributed, and cool flames. For the collocated flame, the presence of single and multiple low-temperature reaction zones is identified, which results from the evaporation and low-temperature chemistry interaction. The impact of low-temperature chemistry on the distributed flame is not pronounced. For low strain-rate conditions, the presence of a weak cool flame without high-temperature reaction zones is reported. Regime diagrams with respect to Stokes number and equivalence ratio are constructed, identifying distinctly different flame structures. By independently varying the strain rate and changing the droplet diameter, qualitatively similar but quantitatively different regime diagrams are obtained due to the lack of intrinsic self-similarity of the spray flamelet solution.},
