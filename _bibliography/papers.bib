	abstract = {Combustion noise is a growing concern for gas turbine designers, especially the presence of prominent tonal structures or thermoacoustic instabilities. High fidelity simulations such as compressible large eddy simulation (LES) have demonstrated great potential in predicting the behavior of these reacting flows, but these methods generate massive amounts of data and efficient techniques are required to isolate the behavior and underlying physics of acoustic structures. Multiple modaldecomposition techniques have gained prominence across a variety of fields for identifying the underlying dynamics of complex systems, including the fast Fourier Transform (FFT), proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). Here, these three techniques are applied to the pressure field taken from a compressible LES of a gas turbine model combustor (GTMC). Comparisons are made between the structures identified by each algorithm as well as the capacity of each technique to identify mode amplitude and assign cardinality to the modes. Lastly, comments are offered about the advantages and disadvantages, including robustness, of the methods studied.},

	abstract = {New phase diagrams for water confined in graphene nanocapillaries and single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are proposed, identifying ice structures, their melting points and revealing the presence of a solid-liquid critical point. For quasi-2D water in nanocapillaries, we show through molecular-dynamics simulations that AA stacking in multilayer quasi-2D ice arises from interlayer hydrogen-bonding and is stable up to three layers, thereby explaining recent experimental observations. Detailed structural and energetic analyses show that quasi-2D water can freeze discontinuously through a first-order phase transition or continuously with a critical point. The first-order transition line extends to a continuous transition line, defined by a sharp transition in diffusivity between solid-like and liquid-like regimes. For quasi-1D water, confined in CNTs, we observe the existence of a similar critical point at intermediate densities. In addition, an end point is identified on the continuous-transition line, above which the solid and liquid phases deform continuously. The solid-liquid phase transition temperatures in CNTs are shown to be substantially higher than 273 K, confirming recent Raman spectroscopy measurements. We observe ultrafast proton and hydroxyl transport in quasi-1D and -2D ice at 300 K, exceeding those of bulk water up to a factor of five, thereby providing possible applications to fuel-cells and electrolyzers.},

The Wasserstein metric can directly be evaluated from scatter data or statistical results through probabilistic reconstruction. The method is derived and generalized for turbulent reacting flows, and applied to validation tests involving a piloted turbulent jet flame with inhomogeneous inlets. It is shown that the Wasserstein metric is an effective validation tool that extends to multiple scalar quantities, providing an objective and quantitative evaluation of model deficiencies and boundary conditions on the simulation accuracy. Several test cases are considered, beginning with a comparison of mixture-fraction results, and the subsequent extension to reactive scalars, including temperature and species mass fractions of \{CO\} and CO2. To demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method in application to multiple datasets, the Wasserstein metric is applied to a series of different simulations that were contributed to the TNF-workshop. Analysis of the results allows to identify competing contributions to model deviations, arising from uncertainties in the boundary conditions and model deficiencies. These applications demonstrate that the Wasserstein metric constitutes an easily applicable mathematical tool that reduce multiscalar combustion data and large datasets into a scalar-valued quantitative measure.},

	abstract = {This article focuses on the development of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for simulations of multicomponent and chemically reacting flows. Compared to aerodynamic flow applications, in which DG methods have been successfully employed, DG simulations of chemically reacting flows introduce challenges that arise from flow unsteadiness, combustion, heat release, compressibility effects, shocks, and variations in thermodynamic properties. To address these challenges, algorithms are developed, including an entropy-bounded DG method, an entropy-residual shock indicator, and a new formulation of artificial viscosity. The performance and capabilities of the resulting DG method are demonstrated in several relevant applications, including shock/bubble interaction, turbulent combustion, and detonation. It is concluded that the developed DG method shows promising performance in application to multicomponent reacting flows. The paper concludes with a discussion of further research needs to enable the application of DG methods to more complex reacting flows.},

	abstract = {The performance, efficiency and emissions of internal combustion (IC) engines are affected by the thermo-viscous boundary layer region and heat transfer. Computational models for the prediction of engine performance typically rely on equilibrium wall-function models to overcome the need for resolving the viscous boundary layer structure. The wall shear stress and heat flux are obtained as boundary conditions for the outer flow calculation. However, these equilibrium wall-function models are typically derived by considering canonical flow configurations, introducing substantial modeling assumptions that are not necessarily justified for in-cylinder flows. The objective of this work is to assess the validity of several model approximations that are commonly introduced in the development of wall-function models for IC-engine applications. This examination is performed by considering crank-angle resolved high-resolution micro-particle image velocimetry (µ-PIV) measurements in a spark-ignition direct-injection single cylinder engine. Using these measurements, the performance of an algebraic equilibrium wall-function model commonly used in RANS and LES IC-engine simulations is evaluated. By identifying shortcomings of this model, a non-equilibrium differential wall model is developed and two different closures are considered for the determination of the turbulent viscosity. It is shown that both wall models provide adequate predictions if applied inside the viscous sublayer. However, the equilibrium wall-function model consistently underpredicts the shear stress if applied in the log-layer. In contrast, the non-equilibrium wall model provides improved predictions of the near-wall region and shear stress irrespective of the wall distance and the piston location. By utilizing the experimental data, significant adverse pressure gradients due to the large vortical motion inside the cylinder (induced by tumble, swirl and turbulence) are observed and included in the non-equilibrium wall model to further improve the model performance. These investigations are complemented by developing a consistent wall heat transfer model, and simulation results are compared against the equilibrium wall-function model and Woschni's empirical correlation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recently, the relevance of tangential diffusion effects has been identified for laminar flames. These effects are not considered in the classical flamelet equations. In the present work, flamelet equations including these effects are derived, and their relevance is investigated by a multi-scale asymptotic scaling analysis. The analysis yields characteristic ratios dependent on the local curvature of the mixture fraction field, the scalar dissipation rate, and the flame thickness, which indicate whether tangential diffusion effects become important. By comparing relevant scales, a regime diagram is developed and three different flamelet regimes are identified. In regime I, the classical flamelet equations are valid. In regime II, differential diffusion of species and temperature in flame-tangential direction becomes relevant. In regime III, additional transport along mixture fraction isosurfaces exhibits an influence on the flame structure. In the latter case it is not sufficient to condition species mass fractions and temperature on the mixture fraction alone since these quantities are not represented by a one-dimensional structure. The asymptotic scaling is verified against fully resolved numerical data of a laminar non-premixed methane–air flame and a turbulent lifted hydrogen jet flame. Budgets of different flamelet solutions of the laminar flame reveal that tangential diffusion effects are dominant over the classical flamelet terms near the flame centerline, while in regions away from it, standard flamelet terms are prevailing. For the turbulent flame, the results show that tangential diffusion effects are more localized and can exceed flame-normal transport, although, unsteadiness is more likely the key factor of the configuration. While the classical flamelet model is applicable for certain flames, this study shows that tangential diffusion effects may require consideration for general flame configurations.},

	abstract = {A pattern search optimization method is applied to the generation of optimal artificial neural networks (ANNs). Optimization is performed using a mixed variable extension to the generalized pattern search method. This method offers the advantage that categorical variables, such as neural transfer functions and nodal connectivities, can be used as parameters in optimization. When used together with a surrogate, the resulting algorithm is highly efficient for expensive objective functions. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in optimizing an ANN for the number of neurons, the type of transfer function, and the connectivity among neurons. The optimization method is applied to a chemistry approximation of practical relevance. In this application, temperature and a chemical source term are approximated as functions of two independent parameters using optimal ANNs. Comparison of the performance of optimal ANNs with conventional tabulation methods demonstrates equivalent accuracy by considerable savings in memory storage. The architecture of the optimal ANN for the approximation of the chemical source term consists of a fully connected feedforward network having four nonlinear hidden layers and 117 synaptic weights. An equivalent representation of the chemical source term using tabulation techniques would require a 500 x 500 grid point discretization of the parameter space.},
