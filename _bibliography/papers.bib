  abs={Microstructural heterogeneities arising from molecular clusters directly affect the nonlinear thermodynamic properties of supercritical fluids. We present a physical model to elucidate the relation between energy exchange and heterogeneous cluster dynamics during the transition from liquidlike to gaslike conditions. By analyzing molecular-dynamics data and employing physical principles, the model considers contributions from three key processes, namely, changing cluster density, cluster separation, and transfer of molecules between clusters. We show that the proposed model is consistent with the energetics at subcritical conditions and can be used to explain the nonlinear behavior of thermodynamic response functions, including the peak in the isobaric heat capacity.}

  abstract={Supercritical fluids exhibit distinct thermodynamic and transport properties, making them of particular interest for a wide range of scientific and engineering applications. These anomalous properties emerge from structural heterogeneities due to the formation of molecular clusters at conditions above the critical point. While the static behavior of these clusters and their effects on the thermodynamic response functions have been recognized, the relation between the ultrafast cluster dynamics and transport properties remains elusive. By measuring the intermediate scattering function in carbon dioxide at conditions near the critical point with X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, we directly capture the cross-over dynamics between 4 and 13 picoseconds, revealing the transition between ballistic and diffusive motion. Complementary analysis using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations reveals that this behavior arises from collisions between unbound molecules and clusters. This study provides direct evidence of the ultrafast momentum exchange between clusters, which has significant impact on transport properties, solvation processes, and reaction kinetics in supercritical fluids.}

  abstract={In the present work, a first-of-its-kind enrichment wall-model is developed within the spectral element method (SEM) framework for large-eddy simulations (LES) of wall-bounded turbulent flows. The method augments the polynomial solution in the wall-adjacent elements with an analytical law-of-the-wall enrichment function representing the mean velocity near the wall. In the solution representation, this enrichment function captures the large gradients in the boundary layer, which allows the polynomial modes to represent the turbulent fluctuations. The enriched solution is able to resolve the shear stress at the wall without any modification to the no-slip wall boundary conditions, which allows for greater accuracy in the near-wall region compared to traditional methods. The enrichment wall modeling approach is implemented in a high-order SEM computational fluid dynamics solver, Nek5000, and its performance is assessed in turbulent channel flow wall-modeled LES for a range of Reynolds numbers. It is demonstrated that the enrichment wall-model improves solution accuracy on under-resolved near-wall grids as compared to traditional shear stress wall-models.}

    abstract = {Uncertainties in wildfire simulations pose a major challenge for making decisions about fire management, mitigation, and evacuations. However, ensemble calculations to quantify uncertainties are prohibitively expensive with high-fidelity models that are needed to capture today’s ever-more intense and severe wildfires. This work shows that surrogate models trained on related data enable scaling multifidelity uncertainty quantification to high-fidelity wildfire simulations of unprecedented scale with billions of degrees of freedom. The key insight is that correlation is all that matters while bias is irrelevant for speeding up uncertainty quantification when surrogate models are combined with high-fidelity models in multifidelity approaches. This allows the surrogate models to be trained on abundantly available or cheaply generated related data samples that can be strongly biased as long as they are correlated to predictions of high-fidelity simulations. Numerical results with scenarios of the Tubbs 2017 wildfire demonstrate that surrogate models trained on related data make multifidelity uncertainty quantification in large-scale wildfire simulations practical by reducing the training time by several orders of magnitude from 3 months to under 3 h and predicting the burned area at least twice as accurately compared with using high-fidelity simulations alone for a fixed computational budget. More generally, the results suggest that leveraging related data can greatly extend the scope of surrogate modeling, potentially benefiting other fields that require uncertainty quantification in computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations.},

  abstract={The mixing dynamics of injected propellants is a key factor in determining the ignition performance and combustion-instability response of rocket engines, internal combustion engines, and gas turbines. A key source of uncertainty in the prediction of phase-exchange dynamics is the immiscibility of the injected propellants at supercritical pressure conditions, which induces liquid/vapor phase separation and surface-tension dynamics. While experimental observations indicate the presence of liquid/vapor interfacial structures, this interfacial dynamics is typically neglected in numerical analyses. To address this issue, the objective of the present study is to systematically evaluate the importance of species immiscibility on the phase-exchange dynamics of cryogenic LOX/GH2 mixing layers at typical rocket engine injection conditions. This is accomplished by comparing simulations of (i) a recently developed interface-capturing Regularized-Interface Method (RIM) formulation, and (ii) the commonly employed Diffuse-Interface Method (DIM) formulation. Analysis shows that the interfacial dynamics significantly impact the atomization and mixing of the propellants in the near-injector region, which is not captured by the DIM formulation. The findings of this study extend to other immiscible injection systems, such as LOX/kerosene and hydrocarbon-fuel/air, thereby highlighting the importance of resolving species immiscibility in simulating high-pressure combustion engines.},

  abstract={Computational models for high-pressure transcritical turbulence in wall-modeled large-eddy simulations typically rely on wall-function models to overcome the need for resolving the boundary layer structures. However, the mechanisms and models of a turbulent boundary layer at transcritical conditions remain poorly understood since the near-wall flow and heat transfer are significantly affected by the enhanced fluctuations and steep gradients in thermodynamic properties. To address this issue, we study the mechanisms of transcritical turbulent boundary layers and wall-attached models at transcritical conditions. It is shown that the real-fluid variable-property effects are associated with the coupling between the near-wall cycle and the wall-normal coherent motions in the outer layer, resulting in the amplification of turbulent energy in the outer layer and noticeable energy transfer between the logarithmic layer and the outer layer; hence, turbulence in the logarithmic layer is modulated by the outer layer. Based on this underlying physical principle, we propose the characteristic velocity and length scales for the attached eddy at transcritical conditions, and extend the attached eddy model to transcritical turbulent boundary layers by introducing a mixed scaling that incorporates both inner and outer scalings. We show that the characteristic scales and extended attached eddy model perform well in characterizing the structures in transcritical turbulent boundary layers.}

  abstract={The injection of multi-species fluids into high-pressure and high-temperature environments beyond the species' critical points is commonly found in engineering applications. At these conditions, for immiscible species, both subcritical interfacial dynamics and supercritical mixing can coexist due to variations in temperature around the mixture critical point. The modeling of these complex transcritical phenomena for large-scale configurations is so far not possible. To address this issue, we propose the Regularized-Interface Method (RIM) as a unified formulation that can describe both sub- and supercritical processes as well as the transition between them. The proposed method is derived via filtering of the nanoscale interface-resolving formulation based on van der Waals' linear gradient theory. Thus, this approach allows for the consistent modeling of interfacial dynamics that vanishes at supercritical conditions, while significantly reducing the temporal and spatial resolution constraints of the original nanoscale formulation. The resulting RIM formulation is examined in interface-capturing simulations of sub-, trans-, and supercritical fuel injection processes, involving droplets and jets. These results highlight the importance of resolving spatio-temporal transitions from subcritical interfacial dynamics to supercritical mixing in high-pressure multiphase simulations, in contrast to commonly employed diffused-interface methods, where interfacial dynamics are often neglected.}

  abstract={Ignition probability maps are useful for characterizing ignition mechanisms in supersonic combustion engines. However, evaluating the ignition probability in 3D scramjet geometries using high-fidelity ensemble simulations is computationally expensive. This work offers a cost-effective alternative by using low-order models to approximate results obtained from 3D large-eddy simulations (LES), with a focus on the RC19 scramjet geometry located at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). To accomplish this, a quasi-3D RC19 mesh geometry that assumes spanwise uniformity is used to generate a 2D probabilistic ignition map using LES. Validated through comparison with experimental and computational ignition maps of the RC19 scramjet cavity, this map is used as a baseline of comparison for low-order model approaches. Statistical quantities from an inert simulation of the quasi-3D scramjet cavity are then sampled to perform stochastic 0D perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) simulations and produce a low-order ignition map. Next, the 0D simulation is modified to incorporate the advection and mixing properties present in the flow, improving the prediction. The ignition maps for the quasi-3D geometry generated from LES and 0D PSR models are compared to assess the performance of the proposed modeling approaches. The 0D PSR and advecting 0D PSR maps produced mean absolute errors of 22.8% and 12.7%, respectively, with a 99.7% reduction in computational cost. Qualitatively, the advecting 0D PSR map produced a profile similar to the baseline LES map in shape and region of highest ignition probability with exception to the left wall region due to the effects of flame kernel growth. Overall, the low-order models serve well as a preliminary assessment of ignition probability by finding ignition locations where higher fidelity simulations can then be focused.}

  abstract={Considerable efforts have been devoted to the understanding of the small-scale characteristics in turbulent flows. While the universality of small-scale quantities has been established for incompressible flows, their extension to high-pressure transcritical flows remains an open area of research. To address this question, we investigate the real-fluid thermodynamic effects on small-scale velocity statistics of high-pressure transcritical wall-bounded turbulence. We show that in the locally isotropic region for transcritical flows, low-order moments of small-scale statistics collapse for all cases and Kolmogorov's (1941) theory holds. However, real-fluid thermodynamic effects introduce deviations in the tails of the probability density function for the velocity derivative and, consequently, high-order moments of velocity gradients and dissipation rate in transcritical flows cannot collapse in the locally isotropic region. Analysis of the intermittency shows that the low-order structure functions in transcritical flows follow extended self-similarity, while the dependence of the intermittency factor on real-fluid effects is observed for high-order structure functions. The real-fluid effects on intermittency are explained by turbulent structures related to rare events. Additionally, the dissipation rate moments for transcritical flows follow a universal scaling with Reynolds number, and the scaling exponents are different from those of incompressible flows. These results extend the small-scale universality in incompressible flows (Schumacher et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, vol. 111, 2014, pp. 10961–10965) to realistic flows with significant changes in thermodynamic properties, and provide a physical underpinning of the scaling laws of small-scale statistics at transcritical conditions.}

Direct noise is computed considering the unsteady heat release predictions while entropy fluctuations in the downstream part of the combustor are used to estimate indirect noise through the transfer function of the outlet nozzle. A low-order acoustic reconstruction technique, which utilizes the Green’s function of the configuration, is developed to compute the acoustics inside the combustor. Comparisons to experimental results are reported, showing the reasonable accuracy of the LES and combustion noise computations. The direct noise spectrum peaks at frequencies around 3 kHz because of the fast timescales associated with the chemical reactions inside the combustor. In addition, the indirect noise is dominant at low frequencies, i.e., less than 400 Hz, because of the characteristics of the entropy spectrum at the outlet nozzle. Compared to a conventional rich-quench-lean (RQL) combustor configuration, significant differences in the acoustics are observed, and are explained by two specific technological novelties. Firstly, the direct noise spectrum peaks at significantly higher frequencies due to the combustor’s compactness. Secondly, the entropy inhomogeneities downstream of the combustion region are an order of magnitude smaller in amplitude due to the lack of dilution with cold air. This leads to a significant reduction in the indirect noise amplitude at low frequencies, where it is the dominant source of noise. These results suggest opportunities for advanced combustion technologies to achieve substantial reductions in combustion-related noise.}

In this concept, the fuel is injected through a coannular duct, resulting in increased fuel-air mixing and minimized formation of soot and other unwanted combustion products. Apart from comprehensive experimental investigations on DFI, so far computational studies have been limited to single-point Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes simulations. Therefore, the objective of this work is to complement these studies by performing large-eddy simulations using a diffuse-interface method to examine the physical mechanisms and combustion processes of DFI, specifically focusing on the mixing process and the effect of fuel-ducting on combustion and pollutant emissions. To this end, finite-rate chemistry simulations are performed of the DFI configuration corresponding to the Engine Combustion Network Spray A injector at transcritical conditions (n-dodecane fuel, 60 bar pressure and 1000 K temperature chamber conditions). A two-equation soot model is employed for the qualitative analysis of soot emissions. Direct comparisons of averaged and instantaneous flow field results with the Spray A configuration are performed to assess the effect of DFI on the first- and second-stage ignition and soot formation. Compared to the free-spray condition, the results show that the DFI case exhibits a combination of (i) increased mass flow rate and entrained air, (ii) larger pressure drop magnitude and flow velocity, and (iii) a closer-to-stoichiometric mixture composition (both globally and locally), each of which is conjectured to contribute toward reduced soot production.}

The modified equation for the pressure equilibrium condition shows that the proposed numerical fluxes introduce different coefficients in the second-order error term, compared to standard numerical fluxes, thereby reducing the pressure equilibrium error.

However, achieving these gains in practical devices that are operated with non-premixed reactants requires overcoming non-idealities in the mixing and combustion process. We investigate these non-ideal effects in the Air Force Research Laboratory’s rotating detonation rocket engine using large-eddy simulation. The simulation results are compared against experimental measurements, showing overall reasonable agreement for critical performance metrics of thrust, specific impulse, and chamber pressure. A wavenumber-domain filtering method is presented to separate the clockwise-rotating waves and counter-clockwise waves, which enables the unambiguous identification of secondary weak waves and their interaction with detonation waves. The analysis of the flow field and response of the injectors shows that these interactions lead to precessing regions of higher pressure, characterized by less parasitic combustion, higher heat release rate, and higher injector blockage. Furthermore, the thrust contributed by the pressure gain combustion process during these interactions is significantly increased, which leads to a modulation of the overall thrust output of the engine.}

The combination of sensors with ANNs shows promise in optical and biomimetic applications. A common ground is identified in the context of statistical physics, where ANN-based methods iteratively adapt their models by blending their initial states with training data.

The NS-EnKF was benchmarked against the stochastic ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) without localization on the Lorenz-96 system. Each filter was run for 100 stochastic trials with 10, 25, and 100 ensemble members. Compared to the EnKF, assimilation of 10 and 25 ensemble members with the NS-EnKF generated predictions which were more stable and had lower state prediction errors. When 100 ensemble members were used, the EnKF had lower prediction error on average while the NS-EnKF continued to offer greater solution stability. Filters were also compared using a numerical shock tube configuration with uncertainty in initial pressures and temperatures. Several trials were run to assimilate sparse pressure observations with varying measurement error into pressure, temperature, and velocity fields. While the relative performance of the EnKF and NS-EnKF varied with the assumed measurement error, both filters improved predictions of shock location as well as pressure, temperature and velocity fields. Results indicate that the NS-EnKF can provide superior prediction accuracy to the EnKF in cases where non-Gaussian distributed states are prevalent, but that further study is required to determine the value of the NS-EnKF in improving state prediction for shock-related applications.}

Machine learning (ML), in particular deep-learning, offers an accurate and cost-effective approach for reduced-order modeling of forced ignition. In this work, we investigate the potential and limitations of ML in modeling ignition, especially in the presence of limited data and multiple ignition modes. To this end, we introduce a hybrid stochastic physics-embedded deep-learning framework that combines sparse experimental data from Schlieren measurements with inert large-eddy simulations for predicting the spatio-temporal evolution of ignition kernel location and morphology. This model combines a stochastic differential equation for modeling kernel dynamics and a deep-learning model for representing kernel morphology. We evaluate this modeling approach for laser ignition of a gaseous methane/oxygen (CH4/O2) model rocket combustor, where morphological effects of the ignition kernel significantly influence ignition behavior. Results demonstrate that this model can reasonably capture behavior associated with the three dominant ignition modes, namely direct, indirect, and failed ignition, along with statistics associated with kernel growth and position, at lower computational costs than high-fidelity reacting simulations. In addition, we demonstrate that this modeling framework can be employed for generating spatially resolved ignition probability maps by incorporating physics to represent kernel interaction with the turbulent jet. We note that limitations in accuracy can be observed when predicting with vastly out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that this physics-embedded ML approach can statistically characterize forced ignition in a more cost-effective manner than reacting high-fidelity simulations, as long as sufficiently representative data is available.}

Porous-media combustion has been shown to be an attractive technology to address flame stabilization challenges with fuel-flexible operation and reduced emissions. In the present work, we address high pollutant emissions in NH3 flames by proposing a two-stage, rich-quench-lean burner architecture, implemented using open-cell ceramic foams with a pore-size-graded topology. We found that this two-stage burner offers substantial improvements in terms of both NOx and NH3 emissions compared to a one-stage burner operated at the same mass flux and thermal power. The effect of operating conditions on emissions was systematically characterized, showing that an equivalence ratio of 1.2 in the primary zone and 0.8 in the secondary zone is optimal, with 15% O2 normalized NOx emissions of 28 ppmv and unburnt NH3 emissions of 149 ppmv, respectively. By using dispersion to promote mixing between the primary zone’s outflow and the secondary injection, the graded ceramic foam in the secondary combustion zone provided further emission reduction, 40% for NOx and 65% for unburnt NH3, respectively, compared to a more conventional cross-flow secondary air injection. To complement these experimental investigations, we performed 1D simulations in order to quantify conversion rates and effects of the secondary combustion zone on the emissions, revealing that a balance between low NO production and high NH3 cracking in the primary zone, and low slippage within the secondary zone, must be achieved to achieve low emissions.},

  abstract={The Flame Surface Density (FSD) model is an affordable combustion model that has been widely used in simulating turbulent premixed flames. In Large Eddy Simulations (LES) with FSD, the combined effect of reaction and diffusion is governed by the Filtered Flame Front Displacement (FFFD) term. While the existing modelling approaches for this term are computationally cost-effective, their predictions still show inconsistencies in certain cases. This study aims to address these inconsistencies by generating Machine Learning (ML) models for the FFFD and FSD terms using the DNS data of a turbulent premixed jet flame. With this approach, the relevance of certain input parameters as well as certain modelling assumptions used for the FFFD term are assessed. Overall, it is found that the resolved curvature term is the most important input parameter to consider and that the resolved progress variable should also be considered in the models. It is shown that the ML models perform significantly better than legacy, algebraic formulations using a priori testing. To further assess the performance of ML, one of the ML models is employed in a a posteriori LES and compared against simulations with the algebraic model. The ML simulation is stable and yields encouraging improvements on key physical parameters regarding the flame length and the FFFD distribution.}

  abstract={A multi-scale U-Net machine learning (ML) model is developed to assess its validity as a surrogate for non-intrusive flame temperature measurement in jet-in-hot-coflow (JHC) flames. Inputs to the model are simultaneous hydroxyl (OH) and formaldehyde (CHO) planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) measurements, with target temperature fields derived from Rayleigh scattering measurements. Coflow oxygen (O) concentration, jet Reynolds number, coflow temperature, and fuel inputs were considered in the dataset, resulting in 33 unique flame conditions, and 17,000 training images. The ML model reconstructs the instantaneous temperature images to within an absolute error of 7 ± 10% of the measured values for the initial natural gas/ethylene model. Transfer learning was employed to accelerate training across conditions of different fuels, with mean absolute reconstruction error of 7 ± 9% for models of ethanol and dimethyl ether. A fourth model including data from all four fuels was trained using transfer learning, with 6 ± 9% error. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classification models were applied to the deepest layers of the four-fuel model to identify whether physical and chemical flame features were being encoded. Experimentally verifiable features were found to be encoded within the latent space of the model, demonstrating that it is not solely an image regression tool, but is capable of predicting flame features including the fuel type, initial coflow temperature, downstream axial location, and coflow O concentration. These findings indicate that the model is not only well suited for temperature predictions, but can provide scientific insight as well.}

  abstract={Supercritical fluids (SCFs) can be found in a variety of environmental and industrial processes. They exhibit an anomalous thermodynamic behavior, which originates from their fluctuating heterogeneous micro-structure. Characterizing the dynamics of these fluids at high temperature and high pressure with nanometer spatial and picosecond temporal resolution has been very challenging. The advent of hard x-ray free electron lasers has enabled the development of novel multi-pulse ultrafast x-ray scattering techniques, such as x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) and x-ray pump x-ray probe (XPXP). These techniques offer new opportunities for resolving the ultrafast microscopic behavior in SCFs at unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, unraveling the dynamics of their micro-structure. However, harnessing these capabilities requires a bespoke high-pressure and high-temperature sample system that is optimized to maximize signal intensity and address instrument-specific challenges, such as drift in beamline components, x-ray scattering background, and multi-x-ray-beam overlap. We present a pressure cell compatible with a wide range of SCFs with built-in optical access for XPCS and XPXP and discuss critical aspects of the pressure cell design, with a particular focus on the design optimization for XPCS.}

  abstract={Ammonia (NH3) has gained increasing attention as a promising carbon-free fuel for compression ignition engines. Nonetheless, its poor combustion characteristics and elevated nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions present substantial obstacles. In the present study, we examine the utility of incorporating NH3 as a low-reactivity fuel (LRF) in diesel-assisted dual-fuel combustion under Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) conditions. Three large-eddy simulations (LES) are performed to quantify the effect of varying concentrations of NH3 as LRF on the ignition characteristics and flame structure. The computational setup corresponds to the Engine Combustion Network (ECN) Spray A configuration, which provides the baseline for the present analysis. The ignition of the dodecane spray is found to be delayed by the presence of NH3, which increases with increasing NH3 content in the ambient. Local flamelets are extracted to examine the evolution of the flame structure starting from ignition at richer mixtures through low-temperature chemistry of dodecane, to finally stabilizing at the stoichiometric conditions. Near ignition, NH3 oxidation is observed to follow the autoignition behavior of the most reactive mixture fraction, whereas at post-ignition the behavior shifts towards canonical premixed flame propagation. This study shows that using NH3 as LRF under RCCI conditions offers an effective solution for NH3 operation in CI engines to reduce carbon emissions.}

  abstract={Rotating detonation rocket engines (RDREs) exhibit significant inhomogeneities in reactant composition upstream of their azimuthally-propagating detonation waves. These inhomogeneities impact performance characteristics of the combustor, as well as complicate the modeling of these systems. This work presents an analysis of a large-eddy simulation of a laboratory-scale RDRE, which resolves many of the inhomogeneities associated with scalar mixing and turbulent combustion. Lagrangian tracer particles are used as an analytical tool to track Eulerian state data, enabling extraction of detonation properties. Using this method, we show that the significant preburning present in this combustor is correlated with lower pressure ratios across the detonation front, consistent with prior results. Furthermore, we show that the detonation wave is distorted by these inhomogeneities into a non-planar shape. This distortion is indicative of pronounced detonation speed variations across the wave front, which is caused by upstream inhomogeneities and leads to the variation in pressure ratio. Finally, the detonation induces recirculation zones, which transport combustion products to the base of the combustor, thereby coupling to the upstream inhomogeneity of the next passing wave.}

  abstract={Controlling the competing temporal scales of advection, mixing, and combustion is critical to maintaining combustion stability in supersonic combustors, where the high free-stream velocity reduces their separation. Flameholding devices, such as cavities, locally increase the residence time by setting up recirculation zones in the flow where combustion may occur. In this work, we use Lagrangian particle analysis to examine the residence time distribution (RTD). We show that that the distribution of time for a single recirculation in the cavity follows an inverse Gaussian function, with a mean dependent on large-scale circulation and a variance dependent on turbulent velocity fluctuations. Using the RTD, a low-order model is then developed that employs a partially-stirred reactor to predict the combustion in the scramjet cavity. This low-order model is used to perform a parametric study, revealing that the stability of combustion depends not only on the mean residence time but also on the shape of the RTD. Combustion may be achieved in reactors with low mean residence times via a sufficiently skewed RTD. These results have implications for improved flameholder designs with less energy loss.}

  abstract={The ignition dynamic of liquid fuel droplets impacting hot surfaces is critical for fire-safety analysis in engineering systems, as well as for controlling wall-filming effects in IC engines. The scenario of slow fuel-leakage rates poses challenges associated with the stochastic processes of droplet splashing, break-up, turbulent mixing, and combustion. To address this, we conduct controlled experiments of liquid n-heptane droplets impacting a heated surface in the Leidenfrost regime, targeting the individual-droplet-deposition conditions. The experiment encompasses a range of surface temperatures and droplet-deposition rates. The experiments are complemented by theoretical analysis, where we developed a stochastic low-order numerical model, demonstrating good accuracy for predicting ignition probability and overall combustion dynamics. Notably, we observe a broad region of intermittent combustion behavior, with ignition probability varying based on surface temperature and droplet deposition rate. Additionally, we find that the transition to consistent ignition relies heavily on both surface temperature and deposition rate. Experimental and numerical model results shed light on the roles of the complex interplay between droplet breakup, chemical kinetics, and evaporation and mixing time scales, as well as the interaction among subsequent droplet combustion events, in governing the ignition and combustion of impacting droplet trains. The revealed dynamic of droplet/hot-surface ignition and the proposed stochastic model hold promise for advancing predictive capabilities of hot-surface-induced ignition and combustion arising from accidental leaks in flammable-liquid piping and wall-filming, particularly in the stochasticity-dominated individual-droplet-deposition regime.}

  abstract={Porous media combustion is a promising combustion technology that enables operation over an extended range of conditions, with a variety of fuels and low pollutant emissions. However, the lack of understanding of the interstitial combustion processes remains a major obstacle towards the application of this technology and the development of predictive models. To understand these processes, this study presents an integrated experimental and computational effort to examine porous media combustion. Specifically, a new experimental diagnostic method is employed that simultaneously combines synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography (CT) and short-wavelength infrared thermometry. With this approach, the surface temperature and the 3D gas-phase temperature field are simultaneously measured inside a porous burner with micrometer spatial resolution. These measurements are then integrated into 3D pore-resolved simulations. This integrated approach enables a direct evaluation of current modeling capabilities, and a unique analysis of interstitial combustion in porous foams under realistic heating conditions. In light of these results, we discover that about 80% of the fuel consumption inside the matrix pores occurs far enough from the porous surface to be characteristic of a decoupled regime of preheated, but adiabatic flamelets. The remaining fuel consumption near the pore surface occurs in a non-adiabatic combustion mode. This insight and the proposed approach contribute to our fundamental understanding of porous media combustion, and suggest that multi-regime models could more accurately describe porous burners.}

abstract = {A diffused-interface approach based on the Allen-Cahn phase field equation is developed within a high-order discontinuous Galerkin framework. The interface capturing technique is based on the balance between explicit diffusion and sharpening terms in the phase field equation, where the former term involves the computation of the local interface normal vectors. Due to the well-known Gibbs phenomenon encountered in high-order discretisations, the accurate evaluation of the normal vectors requires special consideration. To this end, a non-linear preconditioning strategy is proposed where an additional smooth level-set function, advected by the velocity field, is used for the evaluation of the normal vectors. It is shown that for appropriate choices of numerical fluxes and parameters of the model, the phase field remains bounded without any need for explicit regularisation. In order to preserve isolated interfaces, a quasi-conservative discretisation of the five-equation model is employed. A series of numerical experiments of increasing complexity are performed in order to assess the accuracy and robustness of the developed methodology, including two-phase flows involving viscous effects, gravitational forces, and surface tension.}

With this data, we benchmark a total of 49 variations of five deep learning approaches for 3D super-resolution - which can be applied for improving scientific imaging, simulations, turbulence models, as well as in computer vision applications. We perform neural scaling analysis on these models to examine the performance of different machine learning (ML) approaches, including two scientific ML techniques. We demonstrate that (i) predictive performance can scale with model size and cost, (ii) architecture matters significantly, especially for smaller models, and (iii) the benefits of physics-based losses can persist with increasing model size. The outcomes of this benchmark study are anticipated to offer insights that can aid the design of 3D super-resolution models, especially for turbulence models, while this data is expected to foster ML methods for a broad range of flow physics applications.

	abstract = {Combustion noise is a growing concern for gas turbine designers, especially the presence of prominent tonal structures or thermoacoustic instabilities. High fidelity simulations such as compressible large eddy simulation (LES) have demonstrated great potential in predicting the behavior of these reacting flows, but these methods generate massive amounts of data and efficient techniques are required to isolate the behavior and underlying physics of acoustic structures. Multiple modaldecomposition techniques have gained prominence across a variety of fields for identifying the underlying dynamics of complex systems, including the fast Fourier Transform (FFT), proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). Here, these three techniques are applied to the pressure field taken from a compressible LES of a gas turbine model combustor (GTMC). Comparisons are made between the structures identified by each algorithm as well as the capacity of each technique to identify mode amplitude and assign cardinality to the modes. Lastly, comments are offered about the advantages and disadvantages, including robustness, of the methods studied.},

	abstract = {New phase diagrams for water confined in graphene nanocapillaries and single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are proposed, identifying ice structures, their melting points and revealing the presence of a solid-liquid critical point. For quasi-2D water in nanocapillaries, we show through molecular-dynamics simulations that AA stacking in multilayer quasi-2D ice arises from interlayer hydrogen-bonding and is stable up to three layers, thereby explaining recent experimental observations. Detailed structural and energetic analyses show that quasi-2D water can freeze discontinuously through a first-order phase transition or continuously with a critical point. The first-order transition line extends to a continuous transition line, defined by a sharp transition in diffusivity between solid-like and liquid-like regimes. For quasi-1D water, confined in CNTs, we observe the existence of a similar critical point at intermediate densities. In addition, an end point is identified on the continuous-transition line, above which the solid and liquid phases deform continuously. The solid-liquid phase transition temperatures in CNTs are shown to be substantially higher than 273 K, confirming recent Raman spectroscopy measurements. We observe ultrafast proton and hydroxyl transport in quasi-1D and -2D ice at 300 K, exceeding those of bulk water up to a factor of five, thereby providing possible applications to fuel-cells and electrolyzers.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Wasserstein metric is introduced as a probabilistic method to enable quantitative evaluations of \{LES\} combustion models. The Wasserstein metric can directly be evaluated from scatter data or statistical results through probabilistic reconstruction. The method is derived and generalized for turbulent reacting flows, and applied to validation tests involving a piloted turbulent jet flame with inhomogeneous inlets. It is shown that the Wasserstein metric is an effective validation tool that extends to multiple scalar quantities, providing an objective and quantitative evaluation of model deficiencies and boundary conditions on the simulation accuracy. Several test cases are considered, beginning with a comparison of mixture-fraction results, and the subsequent extension to reactive scalars, including temperature and species mass fractions of \{CO\} and CO2. To demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method in application to multiple datasets, the Wasserstein metric is applied to a series of different simulations that were contributed to the TNF-workshop. Analysis of the results allows to identify competing contributions to model deviations, arising from uncertainties in the boundary conditions and model deficiencies. These applications demonstrate that the Wasserstein metric constitutes an easily applicable mathematical tool that reduce multiscalar combustion data and large datasets into a scalar-valued quantitative measure.},

Compared to aerodynamic flow applications, in which DG methods have been successfully employed, DG simulations of chemically reacting flows introduce challenges that arise from flow unsteadiness, combustion, heat release, compressibility effects, shocks, and variations in thermodynamic properties. To address these challenges, algorithms are developed, including an entropy-bounded DG method, an entropy-residual shock indicator, and a new formulation of artificial viscosity. The performance and capabilities of the resulting DG method are demonstrated in several relevant applications, including shock/bubble interaction, turbulent combustion, and detonation. It is concluded that the developed DG method shows promising performance in application to multicomponent reacting flows. The paper concludes with a discussion of further research needs to enable the application of DG methods to more complex reacting flows.},

	abstract = {The performance, efficiency and emissions of internal combustion (IC) engines are affected by the thermo-viscous boundary layer region and heat transfer. Computational models for the prediction of engine performance typically rely on equilibrium wall-function models to overcome the need for resolving the viscous boundary layer structure. The wall shear stress and heat flux are obtained as boundary conditions for the outer flow calculation. However, these equilibrium wall-function models are typically derived by considering canonical flow configurations, introducing substantial modeling assumptions that are not necessarily justified for in-cylinder flows. The objective of this work is to assess the validity of several model approximations that are commonly introduced in the development of wall-function models for IC-engine applications. This examination is performed by considering crank-angle resolved high-resolution micro-particle image velocimetry (µ-PIV) measurements in a spark-ignition direct-injection single cylinder engine. Using these measurements, the performance of an algebraic equilibrium wall-function model commonly used in RANS and LES IC-engine simulations is evaluated. By identifying shortcomings of this model, a non-equilibrium differential wall model is developed and two different closures are considered for the determination of the turbulent viscosity. It is shown that both wall models provide adequate predictions if applied inside the viscous sublayer. However, the equilibrium wall-function model consistently underpredicts the shear stress if applied in the log-layer. In contrast, the non-equilibrium wall model provides improved predictions of the near-wall region and shear stress irrespective of the wall distance and the piston location. By utilizing the experimental data, significant adverse pressure gradients due to the large vortical motion inside the cylinder (induced by tumble, swirl and turbulence) are observed and included in the non-equilibrium wall model to further improve the model performance. These investigations are complemented by developing a consistent wall heat transfer model, and simulation results are compared against the equilibrium wall-function model and Woschni's empirical correlation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recently, the relevance of tangential diffusion effects has been identified for laminar flames. These effects are not considered in the classical flamelet equations. In the present work, flamelet equations including these effects are derived, and their relevance is investigated by a multi-scale asymptotic scaling analysis. The analysis yields characteristic ratios dependent on the local curvature of the mixture fraction field, the scalar dissipation rate, and the flame thickness, which indicate whether tangential diffusion effects become important. By comparing relevant scales, a regime diagram is developed and three different flamelet regimes are identified. In regime I, the classical flamelet equations are valid. In regime II, differential diffusion of species and temperature in flame-tangential direction becomes relevant. In regime III, additional transport along mixture fraction isosurfaces exhibits an influence on the flame structure. In the latter case it is not sufficient to condition species mass fractions and temperature on the mixture fraction alone since these quantities are not represented by a one-dimensional structure. The asymptotic scaling is verified against fully resolved numerical data of a laminar non-premixed methane–air flame and a turbulent lifted hydrogen jet flame. Budgets of different flamelet solutions of the laminar flame reveal that tangential diffusion effects are dominant over the classical flamelet terms near the flame centerline, while in regions away from it, standard flamelet terms are prevailing. For the turbulent flame, the results show that tangential diffusion effects are more localized and can exceed flame-normal transport, although, unsteadiness is more likely the key factor of the configuration. While the classical flamelet model is applicable for certain flames, this study shows that tangential diffusion effects may require consideration for general flame configurations.},

	abstract = {A pattern search optimization method is applied to the generation of optimal artificial neural networks (ANNs). Optimization is performed using a mixed variable extension to the generalized pattern search method. This method offers the advantage that categorical variables, such as neural transfer functions and nodal connectivities, can be used as parameters in optimization. When used together with a surrogate, the resulting algorithm is highly efficient for expensive objective functions. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in optimizing an ANN for the number of neurons, the type of transfer function, and the connectivity among neurons. The optimization method is applied to a chemistry approximation of practical relevance. In this application, temperature and a chemical source term are approximated as functions of two independent parameters using optimal ANNs. Comparison of the performance of optimal ANNs with conventional tabulation methods demonstrates equivalent accuracy by considerable savings in memory storage. The architecture of the optimal ANN for the approximation of the chemical source term consists of a fully connected feedforward network having four nonlinear hidden layers and 117 synaptic weights. An equivalent representation of the chemical source term using tabulation techniques would require a 500 x 500 grid point discretization of the parameter space.},
