## **Join us**
The FX Lab hosts a multitude of graduate students, undergraduates, and postdoctoral fellows. We also occasionally host visiting scholars from other universities. Procedures to join the group depend on the position sought, and each is detailed below. You can also learn more about us here.

### *Graduate Students*

Prospective graduate students should seek admission to Stanford's Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautics & Astronautics, Physics, or similar departments while listing Prof. Ihme as a potential supervisor. Research activities are typically carried out by Ph.D. students; however, research opportunities exist for MS students as well. Students already admitted to Stanford's School of Engineering are encouraged to contact Prof. Ihme directly to assess a potential fit.  

### *Postdoctoral Fellows*

Interested candidates should email Prof. Ihme directly with the following items:

- Resume/CV
- A brief description of previous research
- A list of 2-3 references

### *Undergraduate Students*

Undergraduate students interested in pursuing a part-time research appointment over the academic quarters or full-time for a summer internship should email Prof. Ihme expressing their interest and availability.
