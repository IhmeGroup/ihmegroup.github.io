We are a part of the Mechanical Engineering department at Stanford University and Photon Science at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). Our research aims to develop an improved holistic understanding of fluids in complex environments, with application to energy conversion, propulsion, wildfire modeling, and carbon capture and sequestration. To do so, we combine experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches. Current research activities at the lab include but are not limited to:

- ultrafast X-ray experiments to reveal fluid microstructure,
- large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to characterize macroscopic behavior, and
- large-eddy simulations of combustion systems, ranging from rocket engines to wildfires.
