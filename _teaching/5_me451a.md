Single particle and multi-particle fluid flow phenomena, mass, momentum and heat transfer, characteristic time and length scales, non-dimensional groups; collection of dispersed-phase elements: instantaneous and averaged descriptions for multiphase flow, Eulerian-Eulerian and Lagrangian-Eulerian statistical representations, mixture theories; models for drag, heat and mass transfer; dilute to dense two-phase flow, granular flows; computer simulation approaches for multiphase flows, emerging research topics. Prerequisites: graduate level fluid mechanics and engineering mathematics, and undergraduate engineering mechanics and thermodynamics.
