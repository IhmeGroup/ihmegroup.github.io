This course is concerned with the design analysis of gas-turbine engines. After reviewing essential concepts of thermo- and aerodynamics, we consider a turbofan gas-turbine engine that is representative of a business aircraft. We will first conduct a performance analysis to match the engine design with aircraft performance requirements. This is followed by examining individual engine components, including compressor, combustor, turbines, and nozzles, thereby increase the level of physical description. Aspects of modern engine concepts, environmental impacts, and advanced engine-analysis methods will be discussed. Students will have the opportunity to develop a simulation code to perform a basic design analysis of a turbofan engine. Course Prerequisites: Heat Transfer, Introductory Fluids Engineering, Vector Calculus
