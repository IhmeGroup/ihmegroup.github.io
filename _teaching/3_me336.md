This course is designed to provide an introduction to discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods and related high-order discontinuous solution techniques for solving partial differential equations with application to fluid flows. The course covers mathematical and theoretical concepts of the DG-methods and connections to finite-element and finite-volume methods. Computational aspects on the discretization, stabilization methods, flux-evaluations, and integration techniques will be discussed. Problems and examples will be drawn from advection-reaction-diffusion equations, non-linear Euler and Navier-Stokes systems, and related fluid-dynamics problems. As part of a series of homework assignments and projects, students will develop their own DG-method for solving the compressible flow equations in complex two-dimensional geometries.
